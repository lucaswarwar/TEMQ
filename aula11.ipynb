It took just over two weeks from placing the order.  The dealer (Rutgers computer store) appologized because Apple made a substitution on my order.  I orderedthe one without ethernet, but they substituted one _with_ ethernet.He wanted to know if that would be \"alright with me\"!!!  They mustbe backlogged on Centri w/out ethernet so they\\'re just shipping themwith!  Anyway, I\\'m very happy with the 610 with a few exceptions.  Being nosy, I decided to open it up _before_ powering it on for the firsttime.  The SCSI cable to the hard drive was only partially connected(must have come loose in shipping).  No big deal, but I would have beenpissed if I tried to boot it and it wouldn\\'t come up!The hard drive also has an annoying high pitched whine.  I\\'veheard apple will exchange it if you complain, so I might try to getit swapped.I am also dissappionted by the lack of soft power-on/off.  Thiswasn\\'t mentioned in any of the literature I saw.  Also, the locationof the reset/interupt buttons is awful.  Having keyboard control forthese functions was much more convenient.Oh, and the screen seems tojump in a wierd way on power-up.I\\'ve seen this mentioned by others, so it must be a...feature...Anyway, above all, it\\'s fast.

One solution, sometimes, is to disable \"blind writes\"> To the best of my knowledge there aren\\'t any problems with Quadras andblind transfers.  Trouble with blind transfers usually means the programmerscrewed up the TIBs or didn\\'t test their driver with the device in question.Well designed TIBs poll or loop at every point where delays of >16µsec occur.This usually occurs at the first byte of each block of a transfer but somedevices can \"hiccup\" in the middle of blocks.  If this happens in the middleof a blind transfer there is the possibility of losing or gaining a bytedepending on which direction the tranfer was going.  In anycase the SCSI Managerwill eventually return a phase error at the end of the transaction becauseit is out of sync.  Actual data loss would only occur if the driver didn\\'tpay attention to the errors coming back.Note that this effect is not caused by anything actually on the SCSI Bus butrather by the transfer loops inside the SCSI Manager.  The problem occurs whenthe processor bus errors trying to access the SCSI chip when the next bytehasn\\'t been clocked yet.  Also note that the Bus Error is dealt with by a buserror handler and doesn\\'t crash the machine...Clinton BauderApple Computer',\n",

I ran into this problem a while back; my solution was tochange the source code so that all of these special keys generatedcharacter sequences which basically encoded the keysym and modifierstate as escape sequences -- for example, the sequence \"ESC [ 1 B 7\" would indicate that the \"HOME\" key was pressed, with the shift keydown.  You could also detect standard keys with odd modifiers, suchas \"shift-Return\".If anybody wants these changes, they\\'re welcome to them, but you\\'llhave to have the source available and be comfortable munging withit a bit.  Basically you have to replace the keypress handling codein the source file \"x11term.c\".  Maybe if someone at OSF is interested, I can send them the tweaks, but I imagine they\\'ve gotbigger fish to fry (hopefully including the much talked about emacs V19!).  If there\\'s sufficient interest, I\\'ll post the mods somewhere, although this probably isn\\'t the appropriate group for it.Notes:  * This special code will only apply if you let emacs create   its own (X11) window.  If you run it in plain old tty mode (which    includes Xterm windows) then it\\'s business as usual. * The patches I made were to version 18.58, under Sun OS 4.1.2   [I also did this a while back under HP-UX].

This is a PhD research project and I have to testthe chip at speed on a PCB. I expect to have roughly 100packaged circuits and will do DC, low-speed and high-speedtesting using 3 different set-ups for the test chip. I know for sure that a DIP will not work(the long lead lines have too high an inductance).Getting a custom-made package is too expensive, soI am trying to choose between a flatpak and aleadless chip carrier. The flatpack would be hardto test since it has to be soldered on to the testsetup and I would spend loads of time soldering as I kept changing the test chip. The leadless chipcarrier sockets also have long lead lines and maynot work at high speeds. Does anyone out there have experience/knowledgeof this field ? I would greatly appreciate help! Any ideas/names of companies manufacturing holders/sockets/packageswould help.  P.S. The multi-layer fancy GaAs packages seem like a bitof overkill(?) --- Seema Varma',\n",

Why can't women do the same?Is is biological (ie, not enough room for a bigger bottom plus keys anda wallet) or is it the way they are raised by the parents? \",\n",

A great, great second baseman.Um, the header said *career.*  Hodapp managed about 3000 PA in hisnine years in the majors.As for his \"consistently over .300,\" make that \"three years in a row, preceded by a part-time year, plus his last year, with Boston.\"  Hodapponly qualified for the batting title five times.  Was he injured?  He retired right around his 28th birthday.Anyway, Hodapp put up flashy numbers the year *everybody* put upflashy numbers.  That was his only really good year with a bat; his other .300 years were marred by a lack of power and an inabilityto draw walks.  Only 163 of those 3000 PA were bases on balls, whichdoes not describe a feared hitter.  On the other hand, he was part of the long line of famous Cleveland 2B:Wambsganss, Riggs Stephenson, etc.Roger>>Jon \"Johnny\" Hodapp>jmhodapp@aplcomm.jhuapl.edu>=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=->',\n",

I said we had already agreed on a price and it was  their problem, I wasn't giving them any more money. The finance guy then  brought in the manager on duty who proceeded to give me a hard time. I  reminded him that I was the customer and I didn't think I should be  treated like that and that if he didn't back off he could forget the whole  deal. He made some smart remark so I told him where he could stick it,  snatched back my check and left. Needless to say, they were not pleased by  the turn of events.Early the next morning I got a call from the general sales manager wanting  to know what happened. I related the story and he apologised profusely and  asked if there was anything they could do to change my mind. I told him  that if they gave me the truck for free I probably still wouldn't take it,  that there were other dealers in town, I was a repeat customer of theirs  and that they should learn how to treat customers,etc,etc...I was still  pretty steamed about the whole affair. He gave me the line about hating to  lose a customer and they would try to find a solution, etc, etc. I told  him not to bother, thanks, I'd go somewhere else.A couple hours later, the owner of the dealership called me, all  apologetic, etc, etc, etc, and said that they would cover the $150 plus  knock another $400 off the price of the truck. I told him I'd think about  it and he gave me his private, direct phone number, his secretary's name,  and assured me that they valued me as a customer, etc etc etc....I thought about it for a few hours and discussed it with my wife and we  decided, what the hell...that was a pretty decent deal, so I called him  back and accepted his offer. When I went back the next day to pick up the  truck, I received the royal treatment. Everyone seemed to know about the  incident, even the lot boy. Everything went smoothly and I was out of  there in my new truck in about 30 mins.So, I guess I'm a reasonably satisfied customer. However, it should not  have happened in the first place. I was a bit shocked to have a sales  person talk to me like that. I don't expect them to bow and grovel, but I  sure don't expect to be given a hard time either, esp. when it's their  mistake.Anyway, I'm happy with the truck and it turned out to be a couple hundred  dollars under invoice and they paid most of the first year's license fee.  I'm not sure whether I'll go back to that dealer, tho.Mark\",\n",

On the other hand, the characteristics of transposons weremuch elucidated; the necessity of a cellular reverse transcriptase wasrecognized; and the standard method of recognizing human DNA was created.Other species have different sets of transposons.

Thearcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, and the median eminence regionsare particularly effected.  CVO areas are not subject to theblood-brain barrier. These areas control the release of gonadotropin,which controls the release and flux of steroids governing development,especially sexual development. Changes in adult rats, which are lesssensitive to Glu than humans, have been observed: after ingesting Glu,on a chronic basis, cycles of several steroids are disrupted. Bloodlevels of somatostatin are significantly reduced, and cyclic releaseof steroids becomes flattened.

U.S. District Court Judge Edward Lodgeasks jurors not to hear accounts of the Waco fire becauseof possible influences on the Weaver/Harris case.The testimony of FBI Special Agent Greg Rampton apparentlyended without further incident, as it was mentioned neitherby KTVB nor the _Idaho Statesman_.The day was highlighted by the testimony of Kenneth Fadeley,who had been posing as an outlaw biker and illegal guns personnamed Gus Magiosono.  Fadeley testified that he was acting asan informant for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearmsin his dealings with Randy Weaver.Fadeley began by stating that he had met Weaver in 1987 at anAryan Nations summer conference in Hayden Lake, Idaho.  The twothen met again October 11, 1989 (note the huge separation intime) at a restaurant in Sandpoint, Idaho, to begin a weaponstransaction.  He stated that Weaver had said, \"He felt like he(Weaver) was being prepared to do something dangerous for theWhite cause.\"The two later met October 24, 1989 behind the restaurant andlater went to a city park to make the sale.  During this secondmeeting, Fadeley was wearing a small recording device totape the conversation.  Weaver allegedly showed him an H&R 12-gauge shotgun with a 13-inch barrel and an overall length of19.25 inches.  He additionally showed a Remington 12-gaugeshotgun with a 12.75-inch barrel and an overall length of24.5 inches (NFA requires minimums of 18 inches for barrellength and an overall length of 26 inches).  On tape, Weaveris reported to have said that he could perform better work oncehis machine shop is set up.  The two then discuss the possibilityof future sales.  Fadeley then counts out three hundred dollarsfor the two guns and promises the balance of one-hundred fiftydollars when they next meet.  (Note that the ATF could havesimply arrested him here.  Why did they wait until January 1991 -over a year later - to arrest him?  This is not explained).The next meeting took place on Nov 30, 1989.  Fadeley stated thathis \"source\" had only come up with one hundred dollars insteadof the one-hundred fifty he\\'d promised.  At this point, Weaversuspected he was dealing with an informant, \"I had a guy inSpokane tell me you were bad.\"  Fadeley managed to convinceWeaver otherwise.The _Idaho Statesman_ states explicitly that three tapes weremade of conversations with Randy Weaver.  Thus, each of thesemeetings must have been recorded.  However, the _Statesman_ alsoreported that a tape of a telephone conversation involving VickiWeaver (Randy Weaver\\'s wife) was played to the court.  There musthave also been phone taps.These tapes were played to the court via both headphones andloudspeakers under the objections of Gerry Spence, Weaver\\'sattorney.  Spence said to a KTVB reporter that he wanted tomake sure that the government proved its case, \"...if it has acase at all...\" according to the rules.Randy Weaver tore off his headphones and wept when he heard hiswife\\'s voice on the tape.U.S. District Court Judge Edward Lodge asked jurors not to hearaccounts of the Waco fire because of possible influences on theWeaver/Harris case.  Exactly how such information could affectthis trial is not explained.Other notes: Sunday evening there was a report on KTVB concerningKevin Harris.  Unnamed agents within the FBI admit that they aresurprised that Kevin Harris is still alive.  First, they weresurprised that he survived the initial gunshot wound(s) sustainedin the initial firefight at the Y-junction.  Later, when RandyWeaver was struck by sniper fire the sniper had reported thatHarris had been struck (not Weaver).  Finally, there was a reportthat the FBI agent who killed Vicki Weaver believed he was aimingat Kevin Harris instead.  (This is what was reported).  Criticsare charging that the FBI was blatantly trying to eliminate theonly non-government witness to the deaths of Samuel Weaver andDeputy Marshal William Degan.  Some local people believe thatHarris\\'s survival is simply due to divine intervention.Tuesday, April 20, 1993 will be the sixth day of the trial. Kenneth Fadeley\\'s testimony is scheduled to continue. ',\n",

[Honestly.]The word of Sin is Restriction. [Would I kid you?]Does one man\\'s words encompass the majestic vision of thousandsof individuals?  Quoting a man is not the same as quoting theOrder.  Taken out of context, words can be interpreted muchdifferently than had one applied them within the confines oftheir original expression.I think this is the case regarding Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior of the Order to which I belong.  When he included that bitfrom Merlinus X\\' he did us all a service.  He showed us the extremesto which Order members have been known to go in their fervor.I have little knowledge regarding Reuss\\' background, but surelyhe was an unusual man, and he was an important force in the Order for many years.Yet as people change so do Orders change, and while we look backso carefully at the dirty laundry of O.T.O. remember that this isonly the surface skim and that many perspectives are now encompassedwhich extend beyond any one individual.  I hope to show that therewas and is much room for a difference of opinion within the Orderitself, perhaps by testing the limits myself.Let us examine this issue a bit more closely....\"In 1895, Karl Kellner (1850-1905), a wealthy Austrian industrialistand paper chemist, as well as a high-grade Mason, founded the OrdoTempli Orientis.  Kellner had traveled widely in the East, where hemet three adepts who instructed him specific magical practices.  Kellner\\'s efforts to develop the Order were later assisted by FranzHartmann, Heinrich Klein and Theodore Reuss, who had worked togetherprior to joining the O.T.O.  The Order was first proclaimed in 1902in Reuss\\'s Masonic publication, \\'Oriflamme\\'.  On Kellner\\'s death,Reuss succeeded him as Outer Head [O.H.O.].  The \\'Jubilee\\' edition ofthe \\'Oriflamme\\', published in 1912, announced that the Order taughtsecret of sexual magic. \"Theodore Reuss was an interesting character.  Born June 28, 1855 inAugsburg, he entered Masonry in 1876.  He was a singer, journalist andpossibly a spy for the Prussian political police, infiltrating the SocialistLeague founded by Karl Marx\\'s daughter and her husband.  Reuss waslater associated with William Wynn Westcott, a leader of the GoldenDawn, who later introduced him to John Yarker.  Yarker chartered Reuss tofound the Rites of Memphis and Mizraim in Germany.  After severalattempts to concretize various Masonic Rites, Reuss settled on thedevelopment of the O.T.O.\"The Order experienced reasonably steady growth under Reuss\\' leadership.For example, he chartered Papus in France, Rudolph Steiner in Berlinand H. Spencer Lewis in the USA.  In 1912, the historic meeting betweenReuss and Crowley occurred.  Crowley wrote that Reuss came to him andaccused him of revealing Order secrets.  When Crowley looked at it afresh,the initiated interpretation of sexual magick unfolded itself to him forthe first time.  Reuss appointed Crowley as Supreme and Holy King of allthe English speaking world, and it was this authorization that he invokedwhen publishing the material of the Equinox.\"Reuss resigned as Outer Head of the Order in 1922 after suffering astroke and named Crowley his successor.  All was well until 1925 when_The Book of the Law_ was translated into German.  There was a breakin the continuity of the Order.  Manyk members split with the new O.H.O.over the book, which Crowley was actively promulgating through the Order.He had earlier revise dthe Order rituals at Reuss\\'s request, deeplyinfusing the doctrines of the New Aeon revelation.\"_An Introduction to the History of the O.T.O._, by Ad Veritatem IX\\'Within _Equinox III:10_, Edited by   Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior, Rex Summus Sanctissimus,    Caliph of the United States of America,      Published by Samuel Weiser, 1990.There are many possible reasons that our Frater Superior included thismaterial in _Equinox III:10_.  And this is the real point, is it not?Why did he wish to publish such things about the history of his ownorganization?  Does he represent a dogmatic threat to the principleof Thelema?  Or is he exercising his True Will and putting forth verycomplex pictures with no easy answers?  A picture which leaves roomfor very many interpretations.It is quite easy for me to see, for example, that all of O.T.O. derivedout of the dribble of faltering Masonry, purchased by clever hucksterswith an ounce of courage and some writing ability to aid them.  And Ican take that all the way down to our present Caliph, whose feeblesupport of the \\'Law of Thelema\\' is laughable at best.Would I be thrown out of the Order for speaking in this way?  Will I?  I think not.Why?  Because my Frater will see it as a perspective, an interjectionI am using as an example.  My illustration shows that we may express thingsin the context of a larger work and the true significance of this may bequite difficult to apprehend at first.So it may be with OTO and Merlinus X\\'.  Please look O.T.O. more carefully.I do not support Reuss\\'s words myself, as I am not qualified to assessthem, and I am critical of their pomposity.  If I who am a member ofthe Order take such a stand and am allowed to continue doing so, thenwhat can this say about the health of the Order?  Does it mean thatthe Order has \\'gone soft\\' and abandoned its moral principles?  Ordoes it mean that it is strong in its ability to let the will ofuniversal kinship arise on its own, not shackled by some dogmaticrequirement?  How shall we resolve these two possibilities?I find a high calibre of individual associated with Ordo Templi Orientis.They are often quite intelligent and sometimes very well versed in arcaneor usual information.  They are quite often artists and geniuses.  Having met some 20 longstanding members in the SF Bay Area (many who are orwere very heavily involved with the Order), I can vouch for the integrityof the organization as it stands.I have sometimes questioned the policy of Hymenaeus Beta.  In these moments I followed my intuition, and I\\'ve found little to stop me from requestinga Second initiation from a different O.T.O. body.  I\\'m happily participatingin social groups (Feasts or Initiations) and have come to know the GnosticMass well enough for my tastes. This doesn\\'t make me an authority on Order politics and explanations, however.I can only hypothesize and relay to you what I understand based on mylimited contact with other members.I urge you not to take the words of Merlinus X too far.  There are manyways to interpret words, and many people who have become involved withthe Order feel very strongly about the sanctity of personal freedomand the preservation of individual vision.I welcome other comment on this issue and will be writing more in responseto other posts in this thread.Invoke me under my stars.

Liars can be very pursuasive, just look at Koresh that you yourself site.He has followers that don\\'t think he is a fake and they have shown that they are willing to die.By not giving up after getting shot himself, Koresh has shown that he too is will to die for what he believes.  As far as healing goes.  If I rememer right the healing that was attributed is notconsistent between the different gospels.  In one of them the healing that is done is not any more that faith healers can pull off today.  Seems to me that the early gospels weren\\'t that compeling,so the stories got bigger to appeal better.->Niether was he a lunatic.

Or might not have existed, or any number of things.  That is the logical pitfall that those whouse flawed logic like this fall into.  There are bifurcations (or tri, quad, etc) that are valid, becausein the proceeding steps, the person shows conclusively that the alternatives are all that are possible.  Once everyone agrees that the given set is indeed all there are, then arguments amongthe alternatives can be presentent, and one mostly likely to be true can be deduced by excludingall other possible alternatives.However, if it can be shown that the set is not all inclusive, then any conclusions bases on the incomplete set are invalid, even if the true choice is one of the original choices.  I have given at least one valid alternative, so the conclusion that JC is the real McCoy just because he isn\\'t one ofthe other two alternative is no longer valid.->Some other things to note.  He fulfilled loads of prophecies in ->the psalms, Isaiah and elsewhere in 24 hrs alone.  This in his betrayal ->and Crucifixion.  I don\\'t have my Bible with me at this moment, next time I ->write I will use it.JC was a rabbi.  He knew what those prophecies were.  It wouldn\\'t be any great shakes to makesure one does a list of actions that would fullfill prophecy.

But to suggest that a*disease* is a *punishment* for certain types of sin I think is taking things much too far.  If we got some kind of mouth diseasefor lying, would any of us have mouths left?

Certainly, people who>received tainted blood are not to blame. But it just goes>to show that all mankind is affected by the actions of a few.Yes, sin can have terrible consequences, but we need to be *real*careful when saying that the consequences are a *punishment* for sin.  The Jews of Jesus\\'s time believed that all sickness was theresult of a sin.  Then Jesus healed a blind man and said that man wasblind to show the glory of God, not because of sin.  If AIDS, or anyother STD is a *punishment\" for sexual sin, what do we do with diseases like cancer, or multiple sclerosis, which are just asdebilitating and terrible as AIDS, yet are not usually linked to aspecific behavior or lifestyle?>>In addition, IMHO forgiveness is not the end of things.>There is still the matter of atonement. Is it AIDS ?>I don\\'t know.Atonement is *extremely* important, but I think you\\'ve missed the markabout as far as you can by suggesting that AIDS is an atonement for sin.The atonement for sin is JESUS CHRIST - period.  This is the centralmessage of the Gospel.  A perfect sacrifice was required for our sins,and was made in the Lamb of God.  His sacrifice atoned for *all* ofour sins, past present and future.  God does not require pennance forour sins, nor does he require us to come up with our own atonement.  Hehas graciously already done that for us.  To suggest that AIDS or some other consequence is an atonement for sins is literally spittingon the sacrifice that Jesus made.In case you couldn\\'t tell, I get *extremely* angry and upset whenI see things like this.  Instead of rationalizing our own fears andphobias, we need to be reaching out to people with AIDS and othersocially unacceptable diseases.  Whether they got the disease throughtheir own actions or not is irrelevant.  They still need Jesus Christ,no more and no less than we do.  I\\'ve said this before, but I thinkit\\'s a good analogy.  People with AIDS are modern-day lepers.  Jesushealed many lepers.  He can also heal people with AIDS, maybe not onthis earth, but in an ultimate sense.  My next-door neighbor has AIDS.She has recently come to have a much deeper and more committed relationship with God.  Her theology isn\\'t what I would want it to be,but God\\'s grace covers her.  The amazing thing is that she is gainingweight (she\\'s had the disease for over 2 years) and her health isexcellent apart from occassional skin rashes and such.  She attributesher improvement in her health to God\\'s intervention in her life.  Whoare we to suggest that her disease is some kind of punishment?  Itseems to me that God is being glorified through her disease.Paul Overstreet, the country singer, has a good song title that I think applies to all of us - But for the Grace of God, There Go I(or something like that).May we all experience and accept God\\'s grace.>>------------------------------------------------------------------------->Mark Ashley                        |DISCLAIMER: The opinions expressed>marka@gcx1.ssd.csd.harris.com      |here are my own; they do not>..!uunet!gcx1!marka               |reflect the opinion or policies>The Lost Los Angelino              |of Harris Corporation.>-------------------------------------------------------------------------===============================================================================Paul CondittInternet: conditt@titan.tsd.arlut.utexas.eduApplied ResearchPhone:  (512) 835-3422   FAX: (512) 835-3416/3259  LaboratoriesFedex:  10000 Burnet Road, Austin, Texas 78758-4423University of TexasPostal:  P.O.

Hello, my friends, this is Dr. Beter.  Today is April 30,1982, and this is my AUDIO LETTER(R) No. 74.  It\\'s now been almost one month since war broke out in the SouthAtlantic.  On the surface it seems that it\\'s only a disputebetween Argentina and Great Britain over the barren, wind-sweptFalkland Islands and South Georgia Island.  In reality, it\\'s farmore than that.   The so-called Falklands crisis is just the visible tip of agiant military operation.  During this month of April 1982,fierce naval battles have taken place--not only in the SouthAtlantic but also in the South Pacific.  Up to now most of thehostilities have been kept under wraps by wartime censorship onall sides.  But as I say these words, the naval war in theSouthern Hemisphere is about to come to the surface.   Beginning today, April 30, a total naval and air blockade ofthe Falklands by the Royal Navy has begun.  At the same time acounterblockade has been declared by Argentina in the same area.   To be effective, a blockade must be imposed over a period oftime, but the Royal Navy does not have that much time.  Winter iscoming on in the South Atlantic, and the British supply lines areoverextended.  Having come this far, Her Majesty\\'s navy cannotsimply drop the blockade and sail away in a few weeks timewithout drawing blood from Argentina.  As a result the Britishwill be forced to undertake military operations very soon nomatter how risky they may be.   There is also another reason why the Royal Navy now has nochoice but to engage the Argentine forces in combat.  Thatreason, my friends, is that the Royal Navy has already sufferedlosses in secret combat this month.  Up to this moment there willbe no way to explain away the damage which has been sustained bythe British fleet.  Only when publicly admitted fighting eruptswill the British dare to admit that they have suffered battlelosses.  To obtain that cover story, the British have no choicebut to sail into combat; but in doing so, they will be riskingeven heavier losses on top of those already sustained.  In short,my friends, Her Majesty\\'s navy has sailed into a trap.   The events now unfolding in the South Atlantic carry strange,ironic echoes of the past.  For weeks now we\\'ve been hearingcountless commentators referring to the British task force as an\"armada\" (quote).  The British of all people ought to be veryuneasy with that description.  The original Spanish Armada 400years ago was renowned as a seemingly invincible fighting force,but it came to grief in a naval disaster so complete that itchanged the course of history--and it was none other than theEnglish navy that destroyed the Spanish Armada.   The original Spanish Armada put to sea in 1588 during thereign of England\\'s Queen Elizabeth I.  The Armada was an invasionfleet carrying thousands of crack fighting men to invade England. They were met by the daring sea dogs of Sir Francis Drake.  Drakeand his small, fast ships turned the tables on the Spanish Armadaby changing the rules of battle.  The English fleet was equippedwith new longer-range guns, and it stayed upwind and out ofreach.  From there the English pounded, smashed, and shatteredthe big ships of the mighty Armada.  When it was all over, barelyhalf the Spanish fleet was left to limp back to port.  Drake\\'sdefeat of the Spanish Armada was a shock to the world.  It openedthe door for England under Queen Elizabeth I to start itsexpansion into a truly global empire.   Today, 400 years later, history seems to have come fullcircle.  Queen Elizabeth II is witnessing the dismantling of theworld empire whose heyday began under Queen Elizabeth I, and nowthe cultures of England and of Spain are once again inconfrontation.  Once again a so-called armada is preparing forinvasion, but this time the armada is British, not Spanish.  Fourhundred years ago Sir Francis Drake was the hero of the day;today, the ghost of Francis Drake is once again on the scene.   The South Atlantic war zone is at the eastern end of the DrakePassage around the southern tip of South America.  The defeat ofthe Spanish Armada four centuries ago broke the back of Spain\\'snaval supremacy, and now the defeat of the new British armada maywell break the back of what remains of the once glorious RoyalNavy.   My three special topics for this AUDIO LETTER are:Topic #1--THE MILITARY SECRET OF SOUTH GEORGIA ISLANDTopic #2--THE SECRET NAVAL WAR OF THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERETopic #3--THE ROCKEFELLER FEAR CAMPAIGN AGAINST NUCLEAR WAR.Topic #1--When the Falkland Islands crisis began early this monthit looked at first like a tempest in a teapot.  For a century anda half since 1833, the Islands have been controlled by GreatBritain.  During that entire time, British sovereignty over theFalklands has been disputed by Argentina.  There have beencountless threats by Argentina to seize the Islands, which itcalls the Malvinas, but the threats have always come to nothingin the past and Britain has never even gotten very worried aboutthem.   The Islands are four times as distant from Argentina as Cubais from the United States, and they are not much of a prize. After 150 years of occupancy, the Falklands are home to fewerthan 2,000 British settlers and a lot of sheep.  In short, theremote Falkland Islands hardly look like something to fight over,and yet here we are watching another crisis take place.  We arewatching as war erupts between Great Britain and Argentina.   The Thatcher government is acting as if it has forgotten allabout its usual preoccupation with the Soviet threat at NATO\\'sdoorstep.  Instead, Britain is throwing almost everything it\\'sgot at Argentina---aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers,submarines, assault ships--you name it.  Luxury cruise ships haveeven been commissioned and turned into troop carriers overnight. Wave after wave of additional assault troops have been activatedand sent to join the fleet even after it sailed.  Ships andsubmarines have been pulled off station from normal NATO duty andsent to reinforce the task force.  The initial 40-ship force hasgrown steadily over the past several weeks into an armadanumbering over 70.  Over two-thirds of the entire Royal Navy hasalready been deployed to the South Atlantic off Argentina.   Watching all this, a lot of people are asking: What\\'s thisfight really all about?  The most popular answer suggested in themajor media is \"oil.\"  Vast deposits of oil are known to existunder the continental shelf between Argentina and the Falklands,but that has been known for nearly 10 years.  In no way does itexplain the timing of the sudden military offensive by Argentinathis month, and oil explains even less about the Argentineseizure of South Georgia Island.   South Georgia Island is 800 miles east of the Falklands withno known oil deposits anywhere near it; and compared to SouthGeorgia, the Falklands are an island paradise.  South GeorgiaIsland is covered with rugged mountains, treacherous valleys,glaciers, and semi-permanent snow.  Most of it is uninhabitable. On top of all that, Argentina has absolutely no legal orhistorical claim to South Georgia Island.  In that respect itstands in sharp contrast to the Falklands.   In the early 1830s the Falklands were occupied for a while byArgentine colonists.  In 1833 the British expelled them and tookover the Island.  For that and other historical reasons,Argentina argues that the Falklands really belong to Argentina,not Britain.   But no such argument is possible for South Georgia Island.  Ithas always been controlled by Britain, never by Argentina orSpain.  The Argentine seizure of South Georgia Island looks evenmore unreasonable from a military point of view.  Argentina\\'sleaders are military men and they think in military terms.  Theywere well aware ahead of time that far-off South Georgia Islandcould not possibly be held for long.  By seizing it they weresetting themselves up to absorb a military defeat, as the Islandwas retaken by Britain.  So the question is: Why did Argentina\\'smilitary junta bother with the seemingly worthless South GeorgiaIsland at all?   My friends, the answers to all these questions are military,not political or economic.  South Georgia Island possesses anenormous military secret.  It\\'s a giant underground installationburied under the mountains at the northwest end of the Island. The real reason for the so-called Falkland crisis is this secretinstallation, together with two other similar installations whichI will describe shortly.   The secret military complexes have been in existence for manyyears; they are not new.  What is new is the accelerated nuclearwar timetable of the American Bolshevik war planners here inWashington.  For the past two months I\\'ve been reporting thedetails of this new war plan to you as quickly as I can obtainand verify them.   The plan calls for NUCLEAR WAR ONE to erupt by September ofthis year 1982!!  It is this fast-approaching nuclear war threatthat caused the so-called Falklands crisis to erupt now.   What is going on now is a coordinated effort to spoil part ofthe Bolshevik grand strategy for the coming nuclear war.  Themutual enemies of the American Bolsheviks here--namely, theRockefeller cartel--and Russia\\'s new rulers in the Kremlin arebehind the present crisis.  They are trying to ruin Phase #3 ofthe \"PROJECT Z\" war plan which I revealed last month.  That phaseis to be world domination by the American Bolsheviks after bothRussia and the United States have been destroyed in NUCLEAR WARONE.  As I mentioned last month, the key to this plan is theexistence of secret weapons stockpiles in various places aroundthe world.   The American Bolshevik military planners here in America areworking with other Bolshevik agents in key military positions ofother countries to set off war.  Having done that, they intend toride out the nuclear holocaust they have caused, safe and cozy inGovernment war bunkers!  When the warring nations finally liesmoldering and exhausted, the Bolsheviks will leave the shatteredremains of their host countries.  They will rendezvous at thesecret weapons installations and bring their weapons into theopen.  They will confront the world with the only remainingfresh, up-to-date, powerful military force on earth; and usingthat military power, they will become the undisputed rulers ofthe world--that is, they plan to do all this, and they plan topave the way for world domination very soon by setting offNUCLEAR WAR ONE in a matter of months.  The Rockefeller carteland Russia\\'s new anti-Bolshevik rulers are working together in arace against time to try to head off the Bolshevik war plan.   Last month I mentioned that the Bolsheviks here arebenefitting from war preparations which were started by theRockefellers long ago.  It has only been about three years sincethe Rockefellers were dislodged as the prime movers of the UnitedStates Government by the Bolsheviks.  Since that time the UnitedStates Government has been a house divided, torn by internalpower struggles between rival Bolshevik and Rockefeller factions. But before that, the United States had been dominated for decadesboth economically and politically by the Four RockefellerBrothers.   In 1961 the Brothers launched a new long-range plan for worlddomination.  It was a two-prong strategy, half visible and halfsecret, which I first described long ago in AUDIO LETTER No. 28. It was a plan for the United States to arm to the teeth in secretwhile appearing to disarm gradually.  Without repeating all thedetails, the basic idea was grandiose yet simple.  Bydeliberately appearing weak, the Rockefeller-controlled UnitedStates would maneuver itself into a nuclear war with Russia. Then the secret weapons, including superweapons, would beunleashed to smash Russia and take over the world.   When they set the grand plan in motion in 1961, theRockefeller Brothers were looking ahead to a nuclear war by thelate 1970s.  Their military analysts concluded very early thatthe war being planned would have very different effects on theNorthern and Southern Hemispheres.  Both superpowers, the UnitedStates and the Soviet Union, are located well up in the NorthernHemisphere; so are the other full-fledged nuclear powers--GreatBritain, France, Red China, and India.  By contrast, thestrategic targets for nuclear war in the Southern Hemisphere arerelatively few and far between.  In other words, it was expectedthat the coming nuclear war would be essentially a NorthernHemisphere war.   In an all-out nuclear holocaust it is known that seriousradioactive fallout will gradually spread to affect even areasnot initially hit by war.  But there are limits to how far thewar clouds can spread.  It was discovered long ago that there isvery little mixing between the air of the Northern and SouthernHemispheres.  In the northern half of our planet, cold air fromthe North Pole works its way southward towards the equator, thenit works its way back to the north as warm air.  A mirror imageof this process takes up the southern half of the planet. Northern and Southern Hemisphere air meet in the equatorial zone,but very little of the air changes places.   The military conclusion, my friends, is this: the comingnuclear war could ruin large areas of the Northern Hemisphere forgenerations to come; but if the calculations are right, theSouthern Hemisphere could escape virtually unaffected by the war. This was music to the ears of the Four Rockefeller Brothers.  Aquick look at the globe of the world shows why.  The Rockefellercartel has dominated Latin America ever since World War II.  As Idiscussed in my very first monthly AUDIO LETTER, NelsonRockefeller solidified the cartel grip on Latin America duringthe war.  He accomplished this as so-called \"Coordinator ofHemispheric Defense\" for then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt. So that takes care of the South American continent and itsnatural resources.   Then there is the African continent.  There, too, Rockefellercontrol was already in effect over wide areas of Black Africa,especially south of the equator.  All this was thanks to theefforts of John D. Rockefeller III, as I detailed in AUDIO LETTERNo. 36.   Looking around the globe, the most important remaining landmasses from the standpoint of world domination are Australia andNew Zealand.  Thanks to World War II, both were wide open to theRockefellers.   The Rockefeller Brothers decided to establish secret militaryinstallations in the Southern Hemisphere for use after the comingwar.  By this means they expected to become the masters of thesurviving southern half of planet Earth after the NorthernHemisphere war.  Then, as the Northern Hemisphere graduallyrecovered from the nuclear holocaust, the Rockefeller empirewould be able to pick up the pieces.  In this way the thirdgeneration Rockefeller Brothers expected their family dynasty toinherit the Earth.   In order to control the Southern Hemisphere militarily afterthe war, some means would have to be available to projectmilitary power onto any land mass.  For example, revolts againstRockefeller domination would require troops--not a blast from thebeam weapons on the Moon.  The most critical factor for postwarmilitary domination of the world was found to be a navy.  Aminimum of two secret naval fleets would be required--one basedin the South Atlantic, the other in the South Pacific.  Since thereserve naval fleets were to be kept secret until after theNorthern Hemisphere nuclear war, they could not be built inexisting shipyards.  New construction facilities had to be builtand they had to be hidden.  To hide an entire shipyard is nosmall task; they take up a lot of space.  On top of that, it wasessential that the ships remain hidden after they were built. The best way to achieve that was to combine the shipyard andnaval base into one over-all secret installation.  Finally, thesecret naval installation had to be invulnerable to nuclearattack; otherwise if its existence were ever discoveredprematurely, the secret navy might be wiped out.   The combined requirements for secrecy, space, and protectionagainst attack were formidable; but one day in 1959, while allthese plans were still in the early stages of development, theanswer presented itself.  During a so-called banking trip toSweden, David Rockefeller was given a tour of a unique hiddennaval port.  The port is hollowed out from solid granite cliffswhich come right down to the water.  The entrance to the port isa gigantic hole in the side of the cliff which can be sealed offwith enormous steel doors.  Inside this big doorway on the watera huge cavity has been hollowed out to accommodate ships.   The Rockefeller Brothers and their military adviser decidedthat a bigger, more secret, better protected version of theSwedish hidden port was just what they wanted.  A survey ofcandidate sites was then initiated.  The site survey coveredcoastal areas throughout the Southern Hemisphere.  Many areaswere rejected very quickly because the topography was wrong. Other areas were rejected because they were too close to theequator.  Still others had to be ruled out because there were toomany people living nearby, making the desired level of secrecyimpossible.  Finally, it was essential that the sites chosen forthe secret naval installations be totally secure politically.   At last the sites for the secret naval installations wereselected.  In the South Pacific, extreme southern New Zealand wasselected.  This is what I was alluding to in AUDIO LETTER No. 71three months ago when I called attention to New Zealand\\'s extremeimportance in the coming war.   In order to obtain the necessary space, the secret New Zealandnaval installation had to be divided up into two sites locatedclose together.  One is at the extreme southwest tip of SouthIsland where the mountain range known as the Southern Alps comesdown virtually to the water\\'s edge.  The other part of theinstallation is built into the northwest tip of Stewart Island,which is off the tip of South Island.  The Stewart Islandfacility is hollowed out within a rise known as Mt. Anglem.   The New Zealand location met all the requirements.  Ever sinceWorld War II the government of New Zealand has been tied evencloser to the United States than to Great Britain.  The locationis far from the equator, and the installations are buried deepunder mountains, protected from nuclear attack.  They are alsotoo deep to be reached by particle-beam attacks, and the NewZealand site is well situated to command the entire SouthPacific.   In the South Atlantic an even more perfect site was found. That site, my friends, is South Georgia Island.  It is locatedperfectly for naval domination of the entire South Atlantic.  Thetall, rugged mountains provided a perfect location for the secretinstallation at the northwest tip of the 100-mile long island. It is controlled by Great Britain whose government, like that ofNew Zealand, was willing to cooperate; and South Georgia Islandwas virtually uninhabited except for a whaling station on thenortheast coast.  The whaling station was some 50 miles away fromthe secret new installation which was being built, but Britaintook no chances.  In 1965 the whaling station was closed down. Since that time there have been no inhabitants on South GeorgiaIsland except for a few dozen alleged Antarctic scientists.   Construction of the secret naval facilities--two in NewZealand, one on South Georgia Island--began in the early 1960\\'s. The techniques were adapted from those used previously to buildother large underground facilities, such as the NORADinstallation inside Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado; however thesetechniques were adapted in radically new ways to achieveconstruction access directly from the sea instead of overland. In this way, the sheltering mountain was left undisturbed inappearance both during and after construction.   The cuts in the mountain side which were necessary to letships in and out were kept as small as possible and were wellcamouflaged.  Like the Swedish hidden naval port arrangement, theentrances to the secret installations can be sealed up.  Whensealed, the entrance is virtually impossible to detect unless youknow exactly where it is; and unlike most large constructionprojects, there are no tailings or piles of leftover rock lyingaround to attract attention.  The man-made caverns which housethe secret naval installations are enormous, but all the rock anddebris was disposed of at sea.   Once the secret naval facilities were built, they had to beoutfitted for ship construction and docksite storage.  The fakedisarmament of the United States during the 1960s contributedgreatly to this task.  From 1961 to 1968 one man played a pivotalrole in this elaborate Rockefeller scheme.  He was then-Secretaryof Defense Robert McNamara.  All through the 60\\'s McNamarapresided over the public paring back of America\\'s visiblemilitary power.  This included the closing down and dismantlingof entire shipyards.  What we were not told was where all thatshipyard equipment went afterwards.  Where it went, my friends,was to the new secret installations which were being outfitted inNew Zealand and South Georgia Island!   The secret naval installations have been used as duplicationfacilities to reproduce certain ships and submarines designed andbuilt here in the United States.  As Defense Secretary CasparWeinberger told Congress recently, it is cheaper to build twoships at a time.  That is especially true if the second ship isan exact duplicate of the first.  This has become even more truein recent years through the use of computerized manufacturingtechniques.   The secret naval fleets which have been built at the secretinstallations are made up of duplicates--exact duplicates ofcertain other ships and submarines.  They are all nuclearpowered--nuclear \"subs\"; nuclear cruisers; nuclear destroyers;and yes, nuclear aircraft carriers, three of them.  A secret twinwas built for the U.S.S. Nimitz, for the U.S.S. Eisenhower, andfor the newly-launched U.S.S. Carl Vincent.  All have beenfinanced through the gigantic cost overruns, so called, that weconstantly hear about in the Defense Department; and all threecarriers have been provided with a full complement of aircraftwhose manufacture was financed the same way!   The ships of the secret American Bolshevik naval fleets areall duplicates of other nuclear-powered vessels.  Even so, thesecret naval ships possess one key difference.   Last month I revealed that the so-called \"Stealth Program\" hassucceeded in developing a kind of electromagnetic invisibilityshield.  This technique makes an object invisible from a distanceby distorting light waves in its vicinity.   A whole new fleet of Phantom war-planes are now going intocrash production that use this principle; and, my friends, all ofthe secret American Bolshevik navy ships have already beenoutfitted with similar Stealth-field equipment!  The Stealthprinciple is actually easier to apply to ships than to airplanesbecause there is more room for the powerful equipment thatgenerates the field.   After NUCLEAR WAR ONE, the secret Stealth navy of the AmericanBolsheviks would be light years ahead of any other navy left onearth.  It would be perfect for the intended role of worlddomination.  The Rockefellers set it all in motion long ago, myfriends, but three years ago they lost control of the UnitedStates Military.  Now it\\'s the American Bolsheviks who are incontrol, and they are bent on war.   These secret naval installations have precipitated what isbeing called the \"Falklands crisis.\"Topic #2--In AUDIO LETTER(R) No. 73 last month I described\"PROJECT Z\", the new Bolshevik three-phase strategy for NUCLEARWAR ONE.   An elite group of American Bolshevik military planners hereare flushing out the plan right now at a secret war-room here inWashington.  It\\'s a plan by which the United States will strikethe first nuclear blow, followed by all-out thermonuclear warwith Russia.   Having set off the holocaust, the Bolsheviks here and incertain other countries plan to rise it out safe in comfortablewar bunkers.  Finally after NUCLEAR WAR ONE fizzles out instalemate, they plan to leave behind the ashes of the UnitedStates and her allies.  Activating Phase #3 of their grandstrategy, they plan to unveil their secret weapons, especiallytheir secret naval fleets.  With these they plan to conquer andrule what is left of the world.  The United States as we know itwill be dead and gone; but in the eyes of the Bolsheviksthemselves, this outcome will constitute victory.   Up to now the nuclear war timetable which I first revealed twomonths ago is still on track.  They are still shooting fornuclear war to begin by September of this year 1982!  Time isfast running out.   The Bolsheviks here are sprinting as fast as they can towardwar; but, my friends, the Bolsheviks are not the only runners inthis race.  They have two deadly enemies, both of whom areequally determined to trip up the Bolsheviks.  One enemy of theBolsheviks here is the Rockefeller cartel; the other enemy is thenew anti-Bolshevik ruling clique in Russia; and now these twomutual enemies of the Bolsheviks are pooling their efforts incertain ways.   In AUDIO LETTER No. 71 three months ago I reported that alimited, new anti-Bolshevik coalition was in the works betweenthe Rockefeller cartel and the Russians.  The January 26 meetingbetween Haig and Gromyko in Geneva, Switzerland, was a turningpoint in the formation of this coalition.  It is now a reality,and is responsible for the so-called \"Falkland crisis\" nowdominating the headlines.  It should be emphasized that this newrelationship between the Rockefeller cartel and Russia falls farshort of a true alliance.  They have very major disputes to besettled between them, but for the time being they have called atruce between themselves to deal with their mutual deadlyenemy--the Bolsheviks here in America.   The first priority of the Russians and the Rockefellers is toslow down the Bolshevik preparations for imminent nuclear war. If they can do that, time is on the side of the Rockefellercartel in certain political movements which I discussed lastsummer in AUDIO LETTER No. 67.  A slow-down in the nuclear wartimetable will also give more breathing space for additionalanti-Bolshevik actions to be implemented.   The joint Rockefeller-Russian planners decided by mid-Februarythat military action against the Bolsheviks was essential veryquickly.  No other type of action had any hope of taking effectfast enough to prevent nuclear war by the end of this summer.   The exact details of the \"PROJECT Z\" war plan are not known toeither the Rockefellers or the Russians, but the general outlinesare known to be as I described last month.   It was decided that military action should be devised thatwould undermine Phase #3 of the Bolshevik war plan--that is, theBolshevik-controlled secret naval installations and fleets in theSouthern Hemisphere should be attacked and crippled.  By workingtogether, the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians were able todevise an attack plan which neither could have carried out alone. The Rockefeller group, who built and originally controlled thesebases, provided detailed Intelligence about the best way toattack them.  The Russians with their enormous military machineprovided the muscle to actually carry out the attack.   It was essential to devise a scheme that would enable bothsecret fleets in the South Atlantic and South Pacific to beattacked.  Survival intact of either fleet would leave theBolshevik war plan still workable.   Military analysts concluded very quickly that a direct assaulton the New Zealand facilities was out of the question.  There wasno combination of commandos, frogmen, or other military forcewhich could possibly keep an attack secret from the outsideworld.  Any attack on the New Zealand bases would set off thevery war which the Rockefellers and Russians want to prevent.   But the situation in the South Atlantic was a differentmatter.  In a way, the greatest asset of South Georgia Island wasalso its Achilles\\' heel.  The extreme isolation which protectedthe secrecy of the South Georgia base also made a covert militaryassault feasible.  The key lay with Argentina and herlong-standing claims to the Falkland Islands.   As I mentioned in Topic #1, the Rockefeller cartel hasdominated all of Latin America for decades.  Cartel operativeswere sent to Argentina to work out a deal with the governmentmilitary junta there.  The historic dispute over the FalklandIslands was to be used to provide a ruse, a military cover, toenable the South Georgia base to be attacked.  The Argentinegenerals were not told everything about the situation by anymeans, but they were told enough to make clear what they were todo.   As an inducement to cooperate, the Argentine leaders werepromised handsome rewards.  They were guaranteed that after theshooting was over, the Falkland Islands would remain in Argentinehands.  This guarantee included the promise of covert militaryassistance as needed against the Royal Navy.  And to bolster thetroubled Argentine economy, it was promised that the Rockefellercartel will help develop the immense offshore oil reserves.  Withthese combined promises of military glory and financial rewards,the Argentine military junta agreed to the plan.   On March 19 Argentina carried out Act #1 in the joint attackplan.  A group of Argentine scrap-metal merchants, of all things,landed at the abandoned old whaling station on South GeorgiaIsland.  Supposedly they were there to dismantle the oldbuildings and cart them off to sell.  While they were at it theyalso raised the Argentine flag over the work-site.  The British,always nervous about South Georgia Island, promptly reacted asexpected.  The British Antarctic survey ship \"Endurance\" put 22Marines ashore.  They drove off the scrap merchants and tore downthe Argentine flag.   The incident provided the desired excuse for the ArgentineJunta to bring the simmering 150-year-old Falklands dispute to aboil.  From time to time in the past, Argentina has claimed thatSouth Georgia is part of the Falklands because it is administeredthat way by Britain.  That argument is very flimsy but it nowcame in very handy.  It was nothing new to hear this fromArgentine leaders, so there was no hint of what was really afoot.   During late March, Argentine military forces startedassembling for an assault on the Falklands.  \"Nothing new\",thought the British high command.  Argentina has carried outthreatening maneuvers in the past many times.  It was believedthat they were about to do it again; but on April 2 Argentineforces did the unexpected.  After many past false alarms, thistime they actually invaded and seized the Islands.  All Argentinepublic statements emphasized the long-standing historical claimsto the Falklands themselves; but just for good measure, the nextday a small Argentine force also seized far-off South GeorgiaIsland.  The force was so small that it gave the appearanceinitially that it was just a side show from Argentina\\'s point ofview; however, the small contingent of 22 Royal Marines wereoverpowered and bundled off the Island along with a group of 13alleged scientists.  That was the moment of payoff in the jointRockefeller-Russian attack plan.   Thanks to the elaborate distraction staged by the Argentineforces, a special commando team got onto the Island undetected. Based on the detailed Rockefeller information about the base, theteam moved to a location on the mountain directly above thecavernous secret base.  Special high-speed drilling equipment wasset up by the Rockefeller members of the team while the Russianmembers concentrated on military defense.  By late that evening,April 3, the military high command in London finally learned whatwas really taking place.  The secret South Georgia base was underattack by virtually the only means possible.  The jointRockefeller-Russian team were drilling a shaft down through themountain toward the hollowed out cavern inside.  It was only amatter of time until their drill would break through the ceilingof the giant hidden naval base.  Once the hole was made, the nextstep was obvious.  The Rockefeller-Russian team would put aweapon of some kind through the hole.  The best guess was that itwould be a nerve gas.   The shock waves that went through the highest levels of theBritish government on the evening of April 3 can hardly bedescribed, my friends.  The Thatcher government, like theso-called Reagan Administration here in America, is Bolshevikcontrolled.  That\\'s why Margaret Thatcher always says, \"Me, too\"any time the Reagan Administration says or does anything againstRussia.  Both governments are party to the secret nuclear warplan in complete betrayal of the people of their respectivecountries, and on the evening of April 3 they suddenly discoveredthat their precious war plan was in deep, deep trouble.   Immediately the Thatcher government started assembling a navalarmada to sail for the South Atlantic.  Haste was the order ofthe day.  The drilling on South Georgia Island was proceedingaround the clock.  The best estimates were that the drillingwould break through into the roof of the naval base in aboutthree weeks, on or about April 24.  If help did not reach SouthGeorgia by then, the secret installation might be doomed.  Theforces stationed at the installation itself were unable to defendthemselves under the circumstances.  Their mighty naval shipswere ships in a bottle.  They did not dare open the bottle tosail out to fight because the Russian commandos were armed withtactical and nuclear weapons.  To open the blast-proof entrancedoors would be suicide.   On April 5, just two days after South Georgia Island wasseized, some 40 naval ships began moving out of British ports. The same day Lord Carrington was sacked as Foreign Minister.  Hewas forced to resign, my friends, because he had assisted theRockefeller attack plan by downplaying the Argentine attackpreparations.   That same day, April 5, New Zealand, the home of the othersecret naval fleet, broke diplomatic relations with Argentina. The two hidden New Zealand facilities had been placed on \"RedAlert.\"  As a precautionary measure, all submarines at the twinbase were ordered to sea.  Several surface ships were already atsea undergoing \"sea trials\", but that still left seven (7) majorships inside the hidden twin naval base including one of thenuclear aircraft carriers I mentioned earlier.   On that busy day of April 5, Argentina\\'s Foreign Minister,Costa Mendez, was at the United Nations in New York.  He wasalarmed by the deployment of such a large part of the Royal Navy. Costa Mendez hurried here to Washington to seek reassurances fromcertain officials.  He got them!   For the next two weeks or so the news was filled with storiesabout the allegedly slow movement of the British fleet whilenegotiations went on.  That, my friends, was only a cover story. The Royal Navy was actually joining up and moving as rapidly aspossible toward South Georgia Island.  If the task force arrivedin time to save the secret base, a major battle was likely.  Theofficial stories about \"slow movement\" of the British armada wereintended to give a cushion of time for that battle.  If need be,the fleet would have several days to retake South Georgia Island,then it could move on to arrive near the Falklands on theannounced schedule.  In this way the crucial importance of SouthGeorgia Island would be hidden and the big secret preserved.   It was initially expected that advance elements of the Britishfleet would reach the vicinity of South Georgia Island within twoweeks.  That would have been soon enough to attack the jointRockefeller-Russian commando team and stop the drilling before itwas completed.  But Russian Cosmospheres and submarines made ashambles of the plan.   Key advance elements of the South Georgia attack contingentleft Ascension Island early April 14, two days before it wasannounced officially.  Shortly after they did so, they ran intotrouble.  Russian Cosmospheres and attack submarines closed in ona single ship which was critical to the planned counterassault onSouth Georgia Island.  The Cosmospheres bombarded the bridge andcombat information center of the ship with neutron radiation.  Inmoments the ship was without any command, its communications andradar silenced.  Then a Russian \"sub\" closed in and quicklyfinished off this key British ship with torpedoes.  It brokeapart with secondary explosions and sank rapidly.  So far as isknown, there were no survivors.   This unexpected shock in the mid-Atlantic produced tworesults, both important:First, it caused a slowdown in the race toward the South Atlanticby the British armada.  The task force had to be regrouped into aconfiguration better suited for an enroute defense, but that costvaluable time.  Public announcements from London about theprogress of the fleet reflected this slowdown.  The timetable forarrival on battle stations near the Falklands started stretchingout longer and longer.  All this bought extra time for the jointcommando team on South Georgia Island.  The drilling continued.The other result of the sinking was equally important.  Word wasflashed to the South Pacific Stealth navy to prepare for possibleaction.  It was obvious that the Russian Navy was gettinginvolved in the Atlantic, which meant that the Royal Navy couldbe in big trouble.  During the dead of night, early April 15, theseven Stealth ships put to sea from their twin secret bases insouthern New Zealand.  They deployed to a secret operationalheadquarters area in the Antipodes Islands, 450 miles southeastof New Zealand.  Their electromagnetic shields were operating toprovide protection from attack.  These shields make it impossibleto communicate with the outside world or even to see it, as Iexplained last month; but once they arrived at the Antipodes, theStealth ships hooked up to buoys equipped with shieldedcommunication cables to the Island headquarters.  The Antipodesheadquarters, in turn, was in constant touch with the SouthGeorgia base by way of a transoceanic cable around the tip ofSouth America.  The deployment of the available ships of theSouth Pacific Stealth fleet was exactly what the jointRockefeller-Russian planners had hoped for.  The ships had beenflushed out from their essentially invulnerable hiding place inNew Zealand!   The British ship\\'s sinking of April 14 was also followed byother events.  On April 15 the Argentine Navy started moving outof port.  The same day, Alexander Haig arrived again in BuenosAires.  Supposedly he was there as a diplomat, but in reality hewas there as a General, dealing with Generals.  Haig is the topGovernmental operative of the Rockefeller cartel, as I haverevealed in the past.  He was making sure that the Argentines didnot get cold feet and back down at that critical moment.  Fourdays later, April 19, Haig left for Washington.  As he boardedhis plane, Haig somberly told reporters, \"Time is running out.\" And so it was, my friends, for the secret South Georgia base.   The very next day, April 20, the drill broke through into thehollowed-out cavern of the naval base.  Bolshevik militaryanalysts in London had not expected that it could be completeduntil at least the following weekend.  The British fleet wasstill out of range.   The weapon which the commando team inserted down through thelong hole was a small, compact Russian neutron bomb.  When it wasdetonated inside the confines of the huge artificial cave, theeffects were devastating.  The intense radiation instantly killedeveryone inside the base.  Also the heat and blast effects of thebomb are believed to have damaged all the ships insidesufficiently to badly disable them.   Meanwhile, Russian Cosmospheres and submarines were convergingon the Stealth ships which were near the Antipodes Islandsawaiting orders.  From a distance, the ships were invisible tothe eye due to their protective shields, which also protectagainst beam-weapon attack; but they were sitting ducks for thetactics which the Russians employed.   Floating overhead, the Cosmospheres located the seven shipsusing their Psychoenergetic Range-Finding equipment known as PRF. As I have reported in the past, there is no method known by whichPRF can be jammed.  The Cosmospheres radioed the exact locationsof the ships to the attack submarines.  The \"subs\" were armedwith special non-homing, non-nuclear torpedoes designed toexplode on impact.  More sophisticated torpedoes would have beenthrown off course or detonated prematurely by the protectiveshield of each ship; but these simple torpedoes just cruise rightthrough each invisibility field to strike the ship and explode. Within 15 minutes after the attack began, all seven BolshevikStealth ships were on their way to the bottom, and with them wenttheir Bolshevik Commanders and mercenary crews collected fromaround the world.   The South Pacific action took place just after sunset localtime.  The time here in Washington was around 2:00 P.M. April 23. That evening Secretary of State Haig was seen briefly in publicwith the new British Foreign Minister, Francis Pym.  Pym waswearing the artificial pseudo-smile which diplomats are taughtalways to display in public.  But not Haig.  Haig was grinningfrom ear to ear, and no wonder.  The joint Rockefeller-Russianmilitary operation had been a brilliant success.  The secretBolshevik South Atlantic fleet had been virtually wiped out,bottled up inside South Georgia Island; and the South Pacificfleet, while not totally wiped out, had been badly crippled.  Byworking together, the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians had wonthe secret naval war of the Southern Hemisphere.Topic #3--As I say these words, news reports give the impressionthat war is about to erupt in the South Atlantic, but the realwar in the Southern Hemisphere is already over.  What we arewatching now is the beginning of its bloody aftermath.  Thataftermath is the battle for the Falkland Islands.  They have beenpromised to Argentina as a reward for her role in the secret war.   At this moment the Bolsheviks here in Washington are pressingfor a public announcement that the United States will side withBritain.  As soon as that takes place, military action will heatup fast around the Falklands.  Britain has no choice but tofight.  She has already suffered casualties which cannot beexplained without a public battle; but by fighting, theBolsheviks in Britain are running the risk of a humiliating andtragic defeat for the Royal Navy.   Meanwhile, the Rockefeller strategists here are nowconcentrating on a fast-building, anti-nuclear-war campaign.  Onall sides now we are hearing about the so-called \"nuclear freezemovement.\"  There are documentaries, articles, publicity of allkinds to sensitize us to the terrors of nuclear war.  In recentmonths, there have even been referenda popping up on electionballots dealing with the nuclear war issue.  Medical doctors arebanding together to warn the public about what would happen ifthere were a nuclear war.   We are being told that all this is just popping upspontaneously.  We are now 37 years into the nuclear age andnothing like this has ever gained so much momentum before, yetnow we are supposed to believe that millions of Americans havespontaneously gotten the same ideas at the same time.  If youbelieve that, my friends, I give up.  Movements like this never,and I mean never, develop without leadership, organization, andmoney--and plenty of it.   What we are watching is the Rockefeller public relationsmachine at work.  As I\\'ve explained in the past, the Rockefellercartel cannot afford to let a nuclear war take place.  If itdoes, they will lose everything because they are not in aposition to control it.  Instead, the deadly enemies of theRockefeller cartel, the Bolsheviks here, will win out if there isa war; and so the Rockefeller faction is now doing everything inits power to prevent a nuclear war.   The present anti-nuclear-war orientation of the Rockefellercartel creates certain temporary common interests between themand Russia; but as Russia\\'s new rulers know very well, this doesnot spring from any great moral perspective on the part of theRockefeller group.  It\\'s purely a matter of practical necessityright now for the Rockefellers.   The Russians regard the United States as a house divided, andthey are exploiting that division by working in careful ways withthe Rockefellers.  Their first priority is to rid the world ofthe deadly Bolshevik menace of all-out, even suicidal, nuclearwar; but once that is done, they know that there will be a day ofreckoning with the Rockefeller cartel some day.   The Rockefeller group is working toward a definite objectivewith their new anti-nuclear-war propaganda.  That objective isrenewed power--and power that moves them closer to their olddream of WORLD GOVERNMENT.  The Bolsheviks here have unwittinglyprovided fertile ground for the powerful new Rockefeller antiwarcampaign.  Under Bolshevik control, the so-called ReaganAdministration has become so hawkish that it\\'s scaring people. The Rockefeller antiwar campaign is designed to capitalize onthat latent fear as a tool of power.   These days the smell of war is in the air.  The Falklandscrisis is helping to make that more intense.  The Rockefellerpropaganda machine is now paving the way for the argument thatsurrender of sovereignty is the only way to avoid war.  A newsuper-United Nations of sorts is now in the works to fill thebill.  It will have teeth!  As presently envisioned, the neworganization will be based in Geneva, Switzerland.  The workingname, though this may be changed, is the \"World NonproliferationCouncil.\"  The plan is to bring it into being as the outgrowth ofnuclear nonproliferation treaties, but its true purpose will beto use fear--the fear of war--to control us all.                       LAST MINUTE SUMMARY   Now it\\'s time for my Last Minute Summary.  In this AUDIOLETTER I have reported on the reasons behind the so-calledFalkland Islands crisis.  The crisis erupted because of secretBolshevik-controlled naval installations in the SouthernHemisphere.  These have been attacked by joint action of theRockefeller cartel and the Russians in an attempt to slow downthe nuclear-war timetable.  The attacks were successful, but theresults remain to be seen.  One result, though, is that the RoyalNavy has now been drawn into a trap.  Britain\\'s Waterloo at seamay well be at hand.   My friends, two factions are struggling for control over ourUnited States--the Rockefeller cartel and the Bolsheviks.  Theydiffer in style but both seek to control us through fear.  If weare ever to rise above their trickery, it must be through thepower of our Lord Jesus Christ, our only hope.  As the Scripturetells us, our Lord \"...has not given us the spirit of fear; butof power, of love, and of a sound mind.\"  We must learn to wagepeace.  As our Lord declared long ago, \"Blessed are thepeacemakers: for they shall be called sons of God.\"   Until next month, God willing, this is Dr. Beter.  Thank you,and may God bless each and every one of you.\\x1a',\n",

ADVOCATE OF LUNAR POWER SYSTEM AS ENERGY SOURCE FOR THE WORLD   On April 21, the OASIS and Ventura County chapters of the National Space Society will sponsor a talk by Lunar Power System (LPS) co-inventor and vice-president of the LPS Coalition, Dr. Robert D.Waldron.  It will be held at 7:30 p.m. at the Rockwell ScienceCenter in Thousand Oaks, CA.   Dr. Waldron is currently a Technical Specialist in SpaceMaterials Processing with the Space Systems Division of RockwellInternational in Downey, California.  He is a recognized worldauthority on lunar materials refinement.  He has written orcoauthored more than 15 articles or reports on nonterrestrialmaterials processing or utilization.  Along with Dr. DavidCriswell, Waldron invented the lunar/solar power system concept.   Momentum is building for a coalition of entrepreneurs, legalexperts, and Soviet and U.S. scientists and engineers to buildthe Lunar Power System, a pollution-free, energy source with apotential to power the globe.   For the past three years members of the coalition, nearly halffrom California, have rejuvenated the commercial and scientificconcept of a solar power system based on the Moon.   The LPS concept entails collecting solar energy on the lunarsurface and beaming the power to Earth as microwaves transmittedthrough orbiting antennae.  A mature LPS offers an enormoussource of clean, sustainable power to meet the Earth\\'s everincreasing demand using proven, basic technology.

[*]Since your viewpoint is always the same, the routines can be hard-codedfor a particular vantage.  In my case, wall two\\'s rising edge has a slopeof 1/4. (I\\'m also using Mode X, 320x240).I\\'ve run into two problems; I\\'m sure that other readers have tried thisbefore, and have perhaps formulated their own opinions:1) The routines for drawing walls 1 & 2 were trivial, but when I ran apacked->planar image through them, I was dismayed by the \"jaggies.\"  I\\'mnow considered some anti-aliasing routines (speed is not really necessary).Is it worth the effort to have the artist draw the wall already skewed,thus being assured of nice image, or is this too much of a burden?2) Wall 3 presents a problem; the algorithm I used tends to overly distortthe original.  I tried to decide on paper what pixels go where, and failed.Has anyone come up with method for mapping a planar to crosswise shearedshape?Currently I take:  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64and produce:                         1  2  3  433 34 35 36 17 18 19 20  5  6  7  849 50 51 52 37 38 39 40 21 22 23 24  9 10 11 12            53 54 55 56 41 42 43 44 25 26 27 28 13 14 15 16                        57 58 59 60 45 46 47 48 29 30 31 32                                    61 62 63 64Line 1 follows the slope.

Has anyone come up with a better way?Perhaps it is necessary to simply draw the original bitmapalready skewed?Are there any other particularly sticky problems with this perspective?I was planning on having hidden plane removal by using z-buffering.Locations are stored in (x,y,z) form.[*] For those of you who noticed, the top lines of wall 2 (and wall 1)*are* parallel with its bottom lines.  This is why there appears tobe an optical illusion (ie. it appears to be either the inside or outsideof a cube, depending on your mood).

EDT               Q  For everyone listening on KDKA Radio, I'm Mike Whitely, KDKA Radio News.  We're here at the Pittsburgh International Airport and with me is the President of the United States Bill Clinton.          And I'd like to welcome you to the area and to KDKA.          THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mike.  Glad to be here.          Q  There are a lot of things we'd like to talk about in the brief amount of time we have, but some news is just breaking from Los Angeles.  I guess the entire country has been kind of holding their breath, wondering what's going to happen in the trial of the four Los Angeles police officers.  We just heard that two of those officers, the sergeant, Sergeant Koon and Officer Powell have been found guilty, and two officers have been found not guilty.          It's a situation that's been building for over a year since the first trial and now this trial and this verdict.  And I wonder what your thoughts are this morning on how you see the situation in Los Angeles in connection with your administration and what you're trying to do.          THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, I think the American people should know that this trial, in my judgment, is a tribute to the work and judgment of the jury, as well as to the efforts of the federal government in developing the case.          The law under which the officers were tried is a complex one; the standards of proof are complicated.  The jury decided that they would convict the sergeant who was responsible for supervising the officers and the officer who on the film did most of the beating.  The jury acquitted an officer who kicked Rodney King, but also plainly tried to shield him from some blows, and another officer who was a rookie.          No one knows exactly why they did what they did, but it appears that they really tried to do justice here.  They acknowledged that his civil rights were violated.  And I think that the American people should take a lot of pride in that.  But I hope now we can begin to look ahead and focus on three things:  first of all, the importance of trying to bring this country together and not violate the civil rights of any American; secondly, the importance of renewing our fight against crime.            I think it's important to recognize that in the poorest areas of Los Angeles and many other cities in this country, people may be worried about police abuse, but they're even more worried about crime.  It's time that we renewed our efforts to go to community policing -- put 100,000 more police officers on the street; pass the Brady Bill that would require a waiting period before people could buy a handgun, and do some other things to reduce the vulnerability of our people to violence and drugs.          And the last point I'd like to make is it seems to me that we have got to rededicate ourselves to the economic revitalization of our cities and other economically-distressed areas.  If you just think about it -- if everybody in Los Angeles who wanted a job had one, I don't think we'd have quite as many problems as we do.            And I laid out a very ambitious program in the campaign to try to bring private investment and public investment to bear in our cities.  I have dispatched the Commerce Secretary, Ron Brown, to California to try to come up with some strategies for that state, because it's our biggest state with our highest unemployment rate -- which could then be applied around the country.  I want to talk to him and to the Attorney General, to the new head of the NAACP, to Reverend Jackson, and to several other people, and then I'll decide where to go from here with regard to Los Angeles and the other cities of the country.          Q  Let's talk about what brings you to the Pittsburgh area today.  There have been -- I guess there's been a lot of discussion on Capitol Hill about your stimulus package.  You've been locked in a battle with the GOP.  Yesterday, as you said earlier in your radio address, you made some moves to break that gridlock.  What brings you to Pittsburgh, in particular to Allegheny County, in particular to Pennsylvania, with that battle?          THE PRESIDENT:  Well, there are two reasons.  First of all, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County and Pennsylvania supported me in the last election because they wanted a new direction in economic policy.  We have passed our overall economic plan; it gives the country a very different budget for the next five years than we've had in the previous 12.  We reduced the deficit and, at the same time, increased investment in jobs and education and health care, in the things that will make us a stronger country.          But in addition to that, I asked the Congress in the short run to spend a little more money, a modest amount of money to create another half-million jobs in the next year and a half; to try to cut the unemployment rate by a half a percent; but also to try to spark job creation in the private sector more.  The plan passed the House.  It has the support of a majority of the Senate.  At the present time, all the Republican   senators as a bloc are filibustering the bill.  That is, they won't let it come to a vote.          I believe that Senator Specter would like to vote for the bill.  And I believe that Senator Dole, the Republican leader, has put a lot of pressure on a lot of the Republicans to stay hitched.  And they're all saying that this bill increases the deficit.  It doesn't.  This bill is well below the spending targets that Congress approved, including the Republicans, for this year.  This bill is paid for by budget cuts in the next five years.  This bill is designed to give a jump-start to the economy.  And I must say, a lot of the Republican senators that are holding it up, when Mr. Bush was President, voted for billions of dollars of emergency spending of just this kind --much of it was totally unrelated to creating jobs.          So what I'm trying to do is to break this logjam.  I've held out an olive branch, I've offered a compromise.  But I think that we ought to try to put some more Americans to work right now to show that we're changing the direction of the country.  And that's the purpose of the bill.          Q  Have you been in touch with Senator Specter or his office lately?          THE PRESIDENT:  Well, we've been trying to talk regularly to -- through my White House Congressional Liaison operation to the senators that we think are open to this --Senator Specter, Senator D'Amato from New York, Senator Jeffords from Vermont, Senator Hatfield from Oregon, and five or six others whom we believe know we need more jobs in this economy and know that we are paying for this with budget cuts over the life of the budget I presented.          You know, it has a lot of appeal to say, well, we've got a big deficit, we shouldn't increase it more.  But the truth is that we are paying for this with budget cuts in the whole life of the budget over the next few years.  And more importantly, we have this program well below the spending targets that Congress has already approved for this year.  And they've done this for years, with the Republicans voting for it -- many Republicans voting for it -- for things that weren't nearly as important as putting the American people back to work.            So I just hope that this doesn't become a political issue.  It ought to just be about the people of this country and the need for jobs.          Q  I have some questions from people who supported you, and some people who are skeptical about your administration.  It has to do with their hopes, and also with their fears.  A lot of people who supported you and voted for you in Pennsylvania --I think some of them are now saying, we're glad we got him in the White House, but now look at this incredible process he has to go through.  Look at these problems.  Look at this gridlock.  And they're beginning to wonder, is this going to work; can you pull it off?  And, of course, your skeptics are saying, well, I knew it was going to be like this.          THE PRESIDENT:  Well, what I would -- I'd ask people, first of all, to remember that we are, frankly, moving very fast.  The budget resolution that the Congress passed is the fastest they have ever passed a budget resolution -- ever -- in history, setting out the next five-year budget targets.  So we are moving really rapidly.  And we've got them working on political reform, welfare reform, health care reform, a whole wide range of things.            But it's a big operation.  You can't expect to turn it around overnight.  It took 12 years to produce the conditions which led to the victory I received from the people in November, and we can't turn it around in 90 days.  But I think we're making real, real progress.            I would urge the people not to get discouraged.  We're not going to win every battle, and not everything is going to happen overnight.  But we are definitely moving and changing things.          Q  Thank you very much.            The President of the United States, Bill Clinton, here live at Pittsburgh International Airport.  I'm Mike Whitely, KDKA News.                               END10:31 A.M. EDT\",\n",

Ipser, Jr., 1993>Here\\'s my own top ten response to Mr. Ipser\\'s list10.  It\\'s about time we have a President that might actually stand up to the     military.  Our men and women in uniform must learn that the world does not     revolve around them, and that one of the things they\\'re out there defending     is our right to be critical of them, even denounce them.9.   Let me explain something to you.  Environmental policy and industrial     policy MUST go hand in hand.  Our nation, and indeed, our planet cannot     afford to continue ignoring this as was done over the last twelve years.     Our industrial/environmental position has been downright SHAMEFUL! We     must have active government support of the key industries such as,     telecommunications, microelectronics, medical, biotech, and environmental     tech.  Meanwhile weed out old, inneficient, high-polution, industries     that are better left to other nations.  This will make us richer, help     produce new jobs, and help the environment.  To give credit where credit     is due, I heard a lot of this in a speech by Senator John Kerry (D-MA)     tonite.  In addition, it\\'s time we get really, really serious about      issues like overpopulation, globabl warming, and ozone depletion.  The     planet on which we live should be our utmost priority!8.   It just so happens that that it takes money to make this country work,     to provide the services that people need, and to help solve the problems     that need to be solved.  Granted, some things can probably be done more     efficiently for less money, and should be.  But some things are going to     cost more money and I\\'m sick and tired of hearing everyone whining about     taxes all the time.  You want to live in my country, you pay your fair     share!7.   I can\\'t believe what hypocrites people are when they ask people to give     up their lives for their country and then complain about taxes.  If you\\'re     willing to send me off to die for some stupid obsession with fighting an     enemy which at best doesn\\'t affect us and at worst really should be our     friend, then you have no right to tell me you shouldn\\'t pay taxes!6.   Hey, I think the beaded curtains add a lovely 60\\'s-esque touch!5.   Look, Canada, Europe, and Japan manage to provide health care for their     citizens (and, yes, basic health IS a human right which people are     entitled to).  If these nations aren\\'t capitalist enough for you, then     I guess we\\'ve found something better than capitalism!  There is nothing     sacred about the capitalist system, and if something, be it socialism     or anything else, works better, then I say let capitalism die.4.   Make love, not War!3.   Contrary to popular belief, it is possible to be a male and a feminist     at the same time.  To discriminate against or to deny equal opportunity     to a MAJORITY of the population is just plain wrong, and trying to force     them into some sort of tradition role is even worse.  Women certainly      have as much to offer this world as men, and the day that gender     discrimination is finally broken it going to make all the revolutions of     the past few centuries seem like reform bills.  I look forward to it.2.   See number 10.1.

Gunduz receives an ultimatum: Either         he gives up his honorary position or he will be \"executed\". He         refuses. \"Responsibility\" is claimed by JCAG and SDPA.    May 4, 1982 - Cambridge, MassachusettsOrhan Gunduz, the Turkish honorary consul in Boston, would not bow to the Armenian terrorist ultimatum that he give up his title of \"honorary consul\". Now he is attacked and murdered in cold blood.President Reagan orders an all-out manhunt-to no avail. An eye-witness who gave a description of the murderer is shot down.  He survives... but falls silent. One of the most revolting \"triumphs\" in the senseless, mindless history of Armenian terrorism.

The opinions expressed are those              of the user and not necessarily those of Oracle.Lines: 41As the subjects says, Windows 3.1 keeps crashing (givinh me GPF) on me of  late.  It was never a very stable package, but now it seems to crash every  day.  The worst part about it is that it does not crash consistently: ie I  can't reproduce crashes, and they are not always GPF's in the same  application. Sometimes I can recover by simply closing the application  that caused an error, but other times, windows acts very strange, and I  need to re-boot.Some background:  I have a Leading Edge 486sx25 with Phoenix BIOS.  When I  first got it it had 4Mg of memory.  It ran windows fine (not too many  GPF's).  Then, a couple of weekends ago, I installed Lotus 123 for windows  (with ATM), a game card and an additional 4  1Mg SIMMS.  The Leading edge  machine is kind of strange, in that it has the IDE controler built into  the motherboard, the CPU is actually on a sparate board that plugs into  the motherboard and the SIMMS it uses are Macintosh SIMMS! Apparently I  was told that the Leading Edge had the parity bit built into the mother  board.  The original 4Mg 80ns SIMMS where of the 2 chip variety from  SAMSUNG, and the ones I installed are 8 chip SIMMS. They are recognized  fine by the BIOS RAM check. The game card is a generic $20 gamecard.The reason why I mention the hardware like this is that sometimes  rebooting the machine using the reset button or ctl-alt-del still leaves  the machine kind of flaky, but turning it on and off doesn't. I haven't tried taking out the RAM or the game card, because as I said  these GPF are not reproducible at will.  I have gone through and entire  day using the computer with no problems and then I might get 5 or so GPF's  in the sppace of 20 minutes?What can I do.  This situation is most annoying... Are there any good  diagnostic tools for hardware? Do you think that this might be a software  problem (ie EMM386 etc.)? If it helps, i have manage to get GPF's on After  Dark, quicken, Paint shop pro. A lot of them have been in user.exe or  gdi.exe.Any help is truly appreciated.....-Ericebosco@us.oracle.com\",\n",

Stewart, being an ex-Nordique himself,>was looking to call penalties on the Habs while letting the Nords>get away with murder...WE WAS ROBBED!!!!No.  Patrick Roy is the reason the game was lost, and Ron Hextall is thereason Quebec won.  Everybody said it would come down to goaltending, thatgoaltending was the key, etc etc.  Well, the key doesn't quite fit if you'reMontreal.  The Dionne penalty was kind of a cheesy call, but let's face it;he literally left his feet to throw an elbow.  Blaming Stewart is just anexcuse to avoid facing the fact that Roy allowed what was one of the worstgoals he could possibly allow.  He even saw the whole shot, dammit.  Besides,Stewart evened things up a bit by calling a Quebec penalty in OT.Montreal played a solid game (although they still don't know how to cleartraffic in front of the net; the loss of Schneider will hurt even more). Normally I would say that any team that blows a 2-goal lead with less than five, let alone two, minutes to go in regulation time IN A PLAYOFF GAME ESPECIALLY needs to be smacked upside their collective heads.  But I don'tthink this was a team loss (although Keane should have been able to clear the zone just prior to the first Quebec goal).  Roy is paid big money to play.  He looked like a player in an industrial league on Sakic's shot.Demers should start Racicot in the next game.  If not that, he should letthe damn team read the papers for the next day or two....and maybe thisarticle, if possible.>Patrick Roy collapsed after letting in the tieing goal.

How about Neely though?   Holy shit, what a player.Speaking of great players, man-oh-man can Quebec skate.  I haven't seen ateam so potent on the rush in a long time.  Watching them break out of theirzone, especially Sundin, is a treat to watch.  They remind me of the Red Army.  But I still hate the team.On the rest of the games:  Didn't St. Louis' winning goal come on apowerplay?  Penalties will cost Chicago dearly, especially against Detroit. Same goes for Calgary; very, very undisciplined.  When Marty McSorely iswaving guys to the bench to *avoid* fights, you know something's up.  NewJersey was overmatched, Terreri's heroics notwithstanding.  Mario isunbelievable, and Jagr for some reason shows up in the playoffs.

That depends not only on their predisposition towards murder, but  also in their success rate at escape and therefore their ability  to commit the same crimes again.  In other words, if lifetime imprisonment doesn't work, perhaps  it's not because we're not executing these people, but because  we're not being careful enough about how we lock them up./\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\ Bob Beauchaine bobbe@vice.ICO.TEK.COM They said that Queens could stay, they blew the Bronx away,and sank Manhattan out at sea.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\",\n",

Iasked them why, and all I got was \"Your point is well taken, butOrchid\\'s software developers are busy with other projects.\"So, to get to the point, finally, ARE there any s3 86c805drivers out there that can handle high res hicolor modes?  I\\'d love toget another card, but perhaps it will have to wait until the nextgeneration of cards comes out, since this card came bundled with mysystem and it\\'s not so easy to exchange these things unless they\\'rebroken.If you want these modes, steer away from Orchids s3 86c805cards (ie.

If the magazines are to believed, I\\'ve only seen one s3 86c805product thus far which can handle 1024x768x32k color (Genoa?),although evenn that might be a misprint.Please, if there are generic or semi-generic drivers outthere, let me know where I can get them.  800x600x32k is OK, but Icoulda gotten that with my ATI VGA Wonder XL.Thanks.donyee@athena.mit.edu',\n",

I think that Lee Lady and I are talking at cross purposes.Above, Lady seems concerned with the contrast between greatscience that makes big advances in our knowledge and mediocrescience that makes smaller steps.  In most of this thread, I havebeen concerned with the difference between what is science andwhat is not. Lee Lady is correct when she asserts that the difference betweenEinstein and the average post-doc physicist is the quality oftheir thought.  But what is the difference between Einstein and agenius who would be a great scientist but whose great thoughtsare scientifically screwy?  (Some would give Velikovsky orKorzybski as examples.  If you don\\'t like these, choose yourown.)  I say it is the same as the difference between the mediocrephysicist and the mediocre proponent of qi.  Both Einstein andthe mediocre physcists have disciplined their work from thecumulative knowledge of how previous researchers went wrong.Both Velikovsky and the mediocre proponent of qi have failed todo this.  Let me approach this from a second direction.  When one is askedto review a paper for a journal or conference, there are manykinds of criticism that one can make.  One kind of criticism isthat the work is just wrong or misinformed.  Another kind ofcriticism is that the work, while technically correct, is eithernot important or not interesting.  The first difference is theone that I have been pointing to.  The second difference is theone that Lee Lady seems to be discussing. > If good empirical research were done and showed that there is some merit> to homeopathic remedies, this would certainly be valuable information.> But it would still not mean that homeopathy qualifies as a science.  This> is where you and I disagree with Turpin.  I have often pointed out that for homeopathy to be considered scientific, what is needed is a test of its theoretical claims,not just of some of its proposed remedies.  Similarly, I suspectthat traditional Chinese medicine has many remedies that work;what it lacks (as one example) is any experiment that tests thepresence of qi.> ...

Oh, well . . . one more thing: in case you are thinking that the ABD ports on thenewer models are different from the connection used on the plus---you're right. however, you can use the telephone cable from the plusand connect the mac-pro-plus keyboard via its own rj-11 jack. inother words, this little engineering feat i wish to do *is* possible.it's merely a matter of finding out the correct order. omt, when i get this to work, i definitely will post the solutionso others can, too. thanx for the input. ******************************************************************  Tis the blink of an eye, tis the draught of a breath,        **  From the blossoms of health, to the paleness of death,       **  From the gilded saloon, to the briar in the shroud,          **  O, why should the spirit of mortal be proud?                 **                                                 -William Knox *******************************************************************  shagberg@vm.cmp.ilstu.edu                                    ******************************************************************\",\n",

The characters in a TT or Type 1 font depend on the maker. If someone converts a Type 1 font to TT they'll only get thecharacters in the font of orgin. TT allows for much more flexibilityin this area as well. You can have thousands of glyphs in a TT fontfile (Mac/PS/Windows/Unicode char set) and use the charactersappropriate for the particular platform you are running the font on.Well, yes, both Type 1 and TrueType fonts can contain lots of characters.And in both cases plain text fonts will be reencoded to Windows ANSIin Windows, and to Mac standard roman encoding on the Mac. No difference there between T1 and TT!   And as for fonts with thousands of glyphs, right know these are a liabiliatyrather than a great new thing.  Reason is that a font with 3000 charactersis very large, and if you can only access 224 of them you are paying a heavyprice in downloading time and printer storage.  (And at the moment thereis only one program of that uses `partial font downloading')For instance, all or our fontpack 2 TT fonts have the Mac/Windowschar set in them. The metrics of the fonts are such that if the fontis brought over to the mac the user will have access to the full macchar set. Yes and T1 text fonts all have the `ISO Adobe' character set, which isa superset of Windows ANSI and Macintosh standard roman enocding.The question is whether you can get at the glyphs.  In Windows, for example,you cannot get at the ligatures `fi' anfd `fl' (both T1 and TT)even though afont may very well have them.ANd, while it is somewhat painful to reencode a Type 1 font and to create anew Windows metric file (PFM) for it, there are utilities out there to allowyou do this.  How do I reencode a TrueType font?  How can I get at the`fi' and `fl' ligatures in Windows (or on the Mac)?

In other words, given the doctrine of infallibility, we have no choice   but to obey.This is a primary problem in the Church today.  What you are saying ismore or less heresy.  You might call it \"infallibilism\".  It\\'s theidea that the Pope is always right in everything he says or does.This is virtually all over the place, especially in this country.The Pope is only infallible under certain very specific andwell-defined conditions.  When these conditions are not met, he canmake mistakes.  He can make *big* mistakes.A couple historical examples come to mind.Bishop Robert Grosseteste was perhaps the greatest product of theEnglish Catholic Church.  At one point during his career, the reigningPope decided to install one of his nephews in an English see.  BishopGrosseteste said that this would happen over his dead body (thoughmaybe not in so many words; you have to treat Popes with respect, evenwhen they are wrong).  The problem was that this nephew would justcollect the income of the see, and probably never set foot there.This would deprive the people of the see of a shepherd.  BishopGrosseteste was quite right in what he did!Another example is that of Pope John XXII, a Pope of the Middle Ages.He decided that souls that were saved did not enjoy the BeatificVision until the Last Judgement.  He decided that this should be adefined doctrine of the Church.  Though he didn\\'t quite get around todefining it.  Now there\\'s no way this is compatible with Catholicdoctrine.  The Pope\\'s doctrine was criticised by many in the Church.He went so far as to put a number of his opponents in jail, even.  Inthe end, he had to admit his mistake.  Shortly before he died, herecanted.  His successor made the exact *opposite* idea a dogma of theChurch.If you consult any of the great Catholic theologians who treat of suchsubjects, such as St. Robert Bellarmine (a Doctor of the Church), youwill find detailed discussions of whether the Pope can personally fallinto heresy or schism.The teaching of all such theologians is that the commands of a Popemust be resisted if they are to the detriment of the Catholic Faith.A Pope\\'s authority is given for the purpose of building up theCatholic Church.  Commands in conflict with this purpose have nolegal *or* moral force.',\n",

Both my kids play forthe Santa Clara Valley Hockey Association and this season, which just ended,cost me $75 per kid for membership in Hockey USA, plus $750 per kid for clubdues.  The Hockey USA fees cover excess medical insurance, and the club duescover ice time, officials, trophies, etc.  Other areas have similar fees, unlessthe city government subsidises some of the costs, as Stockton does.By the way; most ice arenas are located in what could be called the \"inner city\"areas.

Santa Rosa\\'s is a nice rink, but it\\'s in an older section of town.Dublin\\'s is outside of town, off 580.  Most of the rinks are old, and expensiveto run, with huge electric bills and insurance premiums.  If you want to buy icetime expect to pay around $100 per hour at any of these rinks.

Right now I have a 15ms 210Mb IDE drive (Seagate 1239A), andwhat I would say is a standard (not special, no cache I believe) IDE controllercard on my ISA 486-50.I'm currently thinking about adding another HD, in the 300Mb to 500Mb range.And I'm thinking hard (you should hear those gears a-grinding in my head)about buying a SCSI drive (SCSI for the future benefit).  I believe I'm gettingsomething like 890Kb/sec transfer right now (according to NU).How would thisnumber compare if I bought the state-of-the-art SCSI card for my ISA PC, andthe state-of-the-art SCSI hard drive (the wailing-est system I could hope for)?Obviously money factors into this choice as well as any other, but what wouldYOU want to use on your ISA system? And how much would it cost?Along those lines, what kind of transfer rate could I see with my IDE HD's if Iwere to buy the top-of-the-line IDE caching controller for my 200Mb, 15ms HD?And how much would it cost?I actually have a PAS-16, and could (what a waste I guess it would be...) hookup a SCSI HD through it's SCSI port which yields an optimum of 690Kb/sec.Actually, I have a borrowed 12ms Fujitsu HD hooked up through it now (andown the Trantor HD drivers for the PAS-16 SCSI port).  Is this SCSI port aSCSI-2 port?  How could I tell?  Is the Fujitsu 2623A a SCSI-2?  Are all SCSIHD's SCSI-2?Thanks for any comments.Randy  \",\n",

In actuality it is \"chorion\", which is the last word Acts> 1:18.  Unfortunately my Greek dictionary does not discuss \"chorion\" so I> cannot report as to the nuances of the word.I abhor publishing trash (I abhor it of myself even more than I do fromothers, but since I do not present myself as an authority on the subject, I donot feel dishonest, though I do openly admit ignorance and incompetence inthis example).  Thus I felt honor bound to do a better set of researchspecifically on the word.  First it should be noted that Greek grammar is notas tough as I first assumed (it is not nontrivial by any means, and I still amnot competent with it, but it is not as opaque as I had thought).  It turnsout that while the Index for the Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich \"Greek Lexicon\" renderseach verse in order, each word within a verse is put in greek alphabeticalorder.  Thus while the the meaning of the verse is decipherable, the syntax isfar from clear.  On the other hand, a Greek-English Intralinear Bible makesthings a lot more comprehendable.  And yes, the word for field in Acts 1:18 isindeed \"chorion.\" Now I\\'ve checked several Greek-English lexicons:\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Louw and Nida\"Robinson\\'s Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament\"\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Grimm\"Word study Concordance,\" Tynsdale\"A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other  early Christian Writings,\" Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich\"The New Analytical Greek Lexicon,\" PerschbacherIn each case the meaning of the word Chorion was given variously as:A space, place, region, district, field, area, \"country place,\" land, farm, estate, \"a bit of tillage\", and similar meanings.Nowhere do any of these books mention anything about \"grave.\" As some of these books go into great detail, I would be very surprised to find that these books are all inadequate and Mr Archer is the only competent scholar in Greek.  I think it more likely that Mr Archer\\'s investigations into \"contradictions\" to be once again, as your friend said it, \"lacking in substance,\" and thus Archer is again shown worthless as an expert witness (By the way Mr DeCenso, I would have honorably presented my results on this matter, even if I had found themto support Mr Archer\\'s contentions). By the way, among these lexicons, (eg: Robinson\\'s) is the definition of\"agros,\" the word used in Matthew 27 to describe the field bought.  The word\"agros\" is defined as \"a field in the country.\" Chorion is specifically notedas a synonym to agros.  This is significant, as it is evidence of how sillyBullinger\\'s exegisis was, which stated that the word for \"field\" in Matthew(ie: agros) is different from the word for \"field\" in Acts (ie: chorion), andthus we must be talking about two different fields (Of course you alreadyadmit how stupid Bullinger\\'s exegisis is, but this was a small serendipitywhich drives the point home). So as of now, unless Mr DeCenso show compelling reasons to believe otherwise(eg: a reputable scholar with reputable references), I consider this particular issue closed.  See Mr DeCenso, now you can go on to answerquestions about the denials of Peter, the day of the Crucifixion, Tyre, and the fact that the author of Matthew quoted from the wrong prophet indiscussing the \"Potter\\'s Field.\" Later,Dave Butler    Precise knowledge is the only true knowledge, and he who does not teach    exactly, does not teach at all.Henry Ward BeecherAmerican Clergymanas recorded by George Seldes',\n",

       " 'From: schmidt@auvax1.adelphi.eduSubject: Grounding power wiring, was Re: a question about 120VAC outlet wiringLines: 163Nntp-Posting-Host: auvax1Organization: Adelphi University, Garden City NYThere has been quite a bit of discussion about house wiring and groundingpractices here.  A few points need to be clarified:The Equipment GROUNDING conductor, Green, green with a yellow stripe, bare, orthe metal sheath or pipe of SOME wiring methods, is used as a safety ground, tocarry fault currents back to the circuit breaker panel, and to limit thevoltage on the metal case of utilization equipment or other metal objects.  Itshould never (except for a few exceptions to be discussed later) carry thenormal operating current of a connected load.  Some equipment has filters inthe power supply which may cause some slight current flow through the groundingconductor.  Much communications or audio equipment is sensitive to noise or slight voltageson the grounding conductor, and may require special wiring of the groundingconductors to provide reliable operation  (\"orange\" outlets are often used forthis, with insulated grounding conductors wired back to the panel box, and inmany cases back to the service.  Anyone installing such a system should readboth the section on grounding in the National Electric Code and publications oninstalling quiet isolated ground systems.  The code requires the insulatedgrounding conductors (green wires) to run with the current carrying conductorsback to the panel box, and, if required, back all the way to the serviceentrance , where it is bonded to the service ground (water pipe or rod)  Manyof these systems are installed illegally or unsafely, where they do not providea safe ground or a quiet ground or either. The GROUNDED conductor of a circuit, often called the NEUTRAL, which isreferred to in the code as the \"identified\" conductor and is supposed to bewhite or natural grey.  This conductor is supposed to be connected to ground inmost electrical systems at a single point, generally at the service entrancepanel.  This connection is through the Main Bonding Jumper.  (In many householdservice panels, the main bonding jumper is actually a bonding screw whichattaches the neutral busbar to the case of the panel)  The Grounded conductor (neutral) is generally a current carrying conductor.  Inthe case of a 120 volt circuit it is one of the two conductors completing thecircuit from the panel to the load device.  Since the grounded conductor (neutral) is only connected to the groundingconductor (bare or green) at the service entrance, if the load is any distancefrom the service and draws any significant current, there will be a small butmeasurable voltage between the grounded and grounding conductors at the load,under normal operating conditions.  If you should (incorrectly) connect thegrounded (neutral) conductor to the grounding conductor at the load, some ofthe neutral current will flow instead through the grounding conductor.  Sincethere will now be current flowing through the grounding conductor, it will alsono longer be quite at ground potential at the load end.  If the load equipmenthas a metal case, which is connected to the grounding conductor through the \"U\"ground plug, the metal case is now also no longer quite at ground potential. The difference (under normal, non short-circuit conditions) may be only a fewtenths of a volt, but it could also be a volt or two.  This normally does notpresent a shock hazard.  HOWEVER, if you let the metal case of the grounded equipment come into contactwith an independently grounded object such as a water or gas pipe, a radiator,a metal air conditioning duct or such, part of the neutral current will try toflow through this aalternate ground path.  If the contact is not solid, youwill get a significant arc (a low voltage, but possibly moderate current arc)Under the wrong conditions, this arcing could start a fire.  It is possible insome cases that the sneak ground current   could also flow through a wire ofinadequate size, causing it to overheat.With the incorrect non single-point grounding of the neutral, if there is ashort circuit from hot to neutral, the high short circuit current which mayflow will cause a much higher voltage on the grounding conductor, whichincreases the possibility for shock or fire.  Also if you incorrectly multiply connect the neutral and ground, the voltage onthe ground system is seen as noise bu computer or audio equipment, oftencausing malfunction.  I have spent some hours tracking down such shorts intechnical facilities where they were inducing severe hum into equipment.The Neutral is usually bonded to the ground at the distribution transformer aswell as at the service entrance of each dwelling.  This is done primarily forlightning protection, so that induced lightning currents have a short path backto ground, and also to assure that the currents drawn by shorts to groundedobjects like pipes draw enough current to trip circuit breakers or blow fusesquickly.  The bad side of this is that not all the neutral current from thedwelling goes through the neutral wire back to the transformer.  Some of itflows through the grounding electrode (water pipe, etc.) this may causecorrosion in the pipes and possibly in things like underground fuel oil tanks,and it may also cause measurable AC magnetic fields due to the large loopbetween the \"hot\" conductors in the service and the neutral current in thewater pipe and ground.  There are those who feel these fields may be unhealthy. (don\\'t flame ME on this, I\\'m just telling you where the field comes from, notit\\'s health effect, as far as I\\'m concerned, the jury is still out on this.)Note that the bonding jumper is only installed at the main panel, NOT at anysub distribution panels.  This is one reason why it is illegal to run serviceentrance cable with the sheath used as a neutral to a sub panel, you must havea seperate insulated conductor for the neutral.  The sheath can be used in thisapplication only as the groundING conductor.  If the neutral is bonded to thegrounding conductor in the sub panel, say by forgetting to remove the bondingscrew, all the grounding conductors of the loads on that panel will be aboveground, with the possible problems listed above.The code makes exceptions for ranges and dryers, as well as feeds from onebuilding to another.  In the cases of the range and dryer, the neutral may beused as the equipment ground under certain conditions, instead of a seperatewire.  Every time the code is revised, these exceptions come up for review. These exceptions were, in fact the first required safety grounds, in the daysbefore U ground outlets and such.  The appliance manufacturers don\\'t want tohave to redesign their ranges and driers, and the contractors don\\'t want tohave to run four wire cable (with four fairly heavy, expensive wires) in placeof three wire to the appliances.  No question it would be safer with seperateneutrals to the stove, but the neutral current is low for most burner settings(since most current is in the 220 volt \"hots\" except at some low settings, thewires are large gauge, and there are few reported cases of injury or damage. So far, the exceptions have survived. In the case of feeds between buildings,it\\'s primarily for lightning protection.People doing wiring should be aware what is and what isn\\'t a legal groundingconductor.  Obviously, the bare wire in \"romex\" \\'with ground\\' is.  Anywherethere is a green wire installed, such as in a portable cord, that is a goodgrounding conductor.  The sheath of BX clamped in BX connectors in metal boxesis a legal grounding conductor (in the US). (BX has an aluminum band run underthe steel sheath to lower the resistance of the sheath.  You can just cut thisaluminum band off at the ends, you don\\'t have to bond it to anything, it doesits job by touching every turn of the BX sheath.) Conduit or EMT (thinwalltubing) is generally a legal grounding conductor, but may require a bondinglocknut where it enters a box or panel, particularly for larger pipes.  \"Greenfield\" (looks like big BX, but you pull your own wires in the emptysheath after you run it) is NOT a legal grounding conductor, as it doesn\\'t havethe aluminum band to bond it, and the spiral steel has too much resistance andinductance.  You have to run a seperate green grounding conductor inside thegreenfield.\"Wiremold\" is also not a legal grounding conductor, as the paint on the boxesoften prevents good contact, and the \"feed\" to the wiremold extension is oftenfrom a box in the wall that may not be well connected to the first wiremoldbox.  I have personally discovered cases where the entire run of wiremold andthe cases of everything plugged into all the outlets on the run were \"hot\" with120 volts (Why do I get a shock every time I touch my computer and the radiatorhere in the office?) because there was no ground wire in the wiremold and oneof the outlets had shorted to the edge of the wiremold box.  You must run aground wire back in the wiremold from the outlets at least to the first box inthe original wiring (conduit, BX, etc.) where you can \"bond\" the wire to thebox with a screw, bnding clip, or whatever.On another issue, while you should ground the green wire/lug on GCFI outletswhen ever there is a place to ground them, it is legal in the NEC to use themwithout a ground if no ground is available.  It is better to have theprotection of the Ground fault interrupter than no protection if you don\\'tinstall it.  The interrupter doesn\\'t depend on the ground to trip.  It isdesirable to connect the ground if available, because if the ground isconnected, the interrupter will trip as soon as a faulty device is plugged in,whereas without the ground, it will not trip until someone or somethingprovides a ground path.  For those questioning the legal use of ungroundedGCFI\\'s, read in the NEC, 210-7 (d) exception. (This is the 1990 code, my \\'93code is in the city, but I know the rule hasn\\'t changed.  It might berenumbered though.) We have only touched the surface concerning grounding ;-} , there is much moreto this subject, but most of you have fallen asleep by now.

I\\'d assume that the problem here is that an MD systemcan have higher tolerances than an MO system as the ear doesn\\'t pick upthe occasional bit error as well as an archiving program!----------------------------------------------------------------------------david shepherd: des@inmos.co.uk                     tel: 0454-616616 x 625                inmos ltd, 1000 aztec west, almondsbury, bristol, bs12 4sq\"They didn\\'t like the rates, they don\\'t like the poll tax, and they won\\'t like the council tax.\"   - Nicholas Ridley   ',\n",

I guess I might believe anything.>>Whats the scoop on this standalone \"drive activity\" every 20 sec?I can only comment on thermal recalibration in general. Some newdrives perform it in order to increase overall integrity of datawrites. Basically, the firmware instructs the actuator to performa test to see if the data tracks are within a certain physicaltolerance, since when the media heats up or cools down, *some*track drift is inevitable, and the drive has to monitor it. Thisbecomes especially critical at very high recording densities, andso was used primarily on very large-capacity mechanisms, but itseems to be finding its way into more smaller drives as a way ofboosting the drive\\'s long-term reliability and MTBF ratings.I first became aware of thermal recalibration when it was pointedout that the technique conflicts with prolonged write times whendigitizing, say, audio or video to hard disk. Some manufacturersexplicitly state that drives with thermal recalibration are NOTto be used for applications that have prolonged disk writes.Hope this helps.Victor',\n",

The accelerator costs about $1400 whereasthe upgrade costs $2131 (just quoted from my dealer).  However the Q700upgrade gives you very fast built in video that supports monitors up to 21\"with 8 bit depth and up to 16\" at 24 bit depth (with additional VRAM).  Italso has a SCSI port capable of a much faster throughput than the CI, whichmakes a big difference if you have a fast hard drive.  If the improved video and SCSI features are important to you, you\\'rebetter off getting the Q700 upgrade, otherwise save some money and get anaccelerator.Paul',\n",

My '79 Honda Accord with 110,000 miles on it started  showing the same behavior.I replaced the brake master cylinder myself.  It took about an hour and cost  about $45.  Sure beats paying $300 to have someone else do it!  If I wanted to  rebuild my own master cylinder instead of putting in a rebuilt one, it would  have cost only $20 to $30 for the rebuild kit.The Honda brake master cylinder is easy to get to.  Two bolts attach it to the  engine compartment.  Two brake lines enter the master cylinder.  The tricky  part was that the brake lines were stuck tight.  My Craftsmen open end wrench  rounded off the bolt heads!  I had to use Vise Grips to loosen those suckers.   Wow!  Best invention since sliced bread.  After that it was very easy.  Bolt  the new part in place, add new brake fluid, and bleed the brakes.This is quite easy even for a beginner.  My local auto parts store had a repair  manual for the Honda Accord; it had detailed diagrams of the master brake  cylinder and a step-by-step procedure for replacing it.\",\n",

Piazza looked GREAT behind the plate, gunning down a runnertrying to steal second, throwing a runner out at first whohad strayed a bit from first base, etc. Karros also made a spectacular play, keeping a ball from going intothe outfield.  The runner on first was so sure that ball was goingthrough, he just kept running past second.  Karros got up and threwto third and EASILY got the runner at third. My heart sank in the 7th when Gross got up to warm up in the bullpen. Astacio was lifted for a pinch hitter, and when Gross entered the gamewith the score still 2-2, Dodger fans just KNEW it was over. Gross was relieving because he stunk on Tuesday, pitching just 2 1/3innings, forcing Lasorda to use much of his bullpen.  The 15 inninggame had the same effect the next night...so only Gross was freshgiven his light work out Tuesday. Gross lived up to his name.  He walked the first batter, gave up a hitto the second, and walked the bases loaded.  After a grounder resultedin a force at home, Zeile lifted a scoring fly ball to make it3-2 Cards.  Gross paid little attention to the runners, and the nextthing you knew, the Cards had stolen a fourth run.  The runner onfirst was eventually tagged out in the run down, but the 4th run hadscored long before that. Meanwhile, the Dodgers mounted little offense after the second inning.Lee Smith pitched the ninth.  He had little trouble getting Karrosand Wallach (does anyone have trouble with Wallach these days?).Cory Snyder collected his first hit as a Dodger, a single, butthat was all the offense the Dodgers could mount.  Smith got histhird straight save against the Dodgers and all I got was myfree Dodger cap and a good look at Piazza.  If Piazza keeps thisup all year, he will be a strong candidate for rookie of the yearhonors.  Though its really early, Karros is already showing signsof a sophomore jinx year. The final score...Cardinals 4 runs on 7 hits.Dodgers 2 runs on 7 hits. Dodger',\n",

The sermon wasbased on a story in the Book of Joshua.  (The one about Joshua sending outspies to the land he was planning to take)  What I particularly remember,because of having heard part of a CBC radio documentary on Bosnia, was thatthe Rahab (the woman who sheltered the spies) said that the people were\"melting in fear.\"  What with having heard that CBC radio documentary andknowing that the Muslims in Bosnia were losing the war, I feltuncomfortable.  After all, the Serbs are driving non-Christians out.  Onthe other hand, ministers do say that the Bible is opposed to the valuesheld by our secular society.  Anyhow members of that church are involved inout-of-country missionary work.  Also, the pastor has talked of spiritualwarfare and of bringing Christ to the nonreligious people of our area.The next Sunday, the sermon was about Joshua 6 (where the Israelitestake Jericho and then proceed to massacre everybody there --- exceptfor Rahab, who had sheltered the spies).  With those reports aboutBosnia in my mind, I felt uncomfortable about the minister saying thatthe massacre (the one in Joshua) was right.  But what really botheredme was that, if I was going to try taking Christianity seriously, Ishouldn\\'t be so troubled about the reports of \"ethnic cleansing\" inBosnia.  Certainly, my sympathies shouldn\\'t be with the Moslims.Considering that the Bosnian Muslims are descendants of Christianswho, under Turkish rule, converted to Islam could the Serbs be doingGod\\'s work?[The example of God\\'s people setting out on bloody wars of conquesthas always been troubling in discussions here.  I personally questionwhether they were right even at the time.  But those who believe theywere consider that the wars were justified only because they werespecifically commanded by God.  Somehow I don\\'t see the Serbs behavinglike a group that is led by God in this matter.  --clh]',\n",

Friday local Tel Aviv\\'spaper, affiliated with Maariv.Date: 19 February 1993Journalist: Guy EhrlichSubject: Interview with soldiers who served in the Duvdevan(Cherry) units, which disguise themselves as Arabs and operatewithin the occupied territories.Excerpts from the article:\"A lot has been written about the units who disguise themselves asArabs, things good and bad, some of the falsehoods. But the mostimportant problem of those units has been hardly dealt with. It isthat everyone who serves in the Cherry, after a time goes in oneway or another insane\".A man who said this, who will here be called Danny (his full nameis known to the editors) served in the Cherry. After his dischargefrom the army he works as delivery boy. His pal, who will here becalled Dudu was also serving in the Cherry, and is now about todepart for a round-the-world tour. They both look no differentfrom average Israeli youngsters freshly discharged from conscriptservice. But in their souls, one can notice something completelydifferent....It was not easy for them to come out with disclosuresabout what happened to them. And they think that to most of theirfellows from the Cherry it woundn\\'t be easy either. Yet after theybegan to talk, it was nearly impossible to make them stop talking.The following article will contain all the horror storiesrecounted with an appalling openness.(...) A short time ago I was in command of a veteran team, inwhich some of the fellows applied for release from the Cherry. Wecalled such soldiers H.I. \\'Hit by the Intifada\\'. Under my commandwas a soldier who talked to himself non-stop, which is a commonphenomenon in the Cherry. I sent him to a psychiatrist. But why Ishould talk about others when I myself feel quite insane ? OnFridays, when I come home, my parents know I cannot be talked tountil I go to the beach, surf a little, calm down and return. Thekeys of my father\\'s car must be ready for in advance, so that Ican go there. I they dare talk to me before, or whenever I don\\'twant them to talk to me, I just grab a chair and smash itinstantly. I know it is my nerve:  Smashing chairs all the timeand then running away from home, to the car and to the beach. Onlythere I become normal.(...)(...) Another friday I was eating a lunch prepared by my mother.It was an omelette of sorts. She took the risk of sitting next tome and talking to me. I then told my mother about an event whichwas still fresh in my mind. I told her how I shot an Arab, and howexactly his wound looked like when I went to inspect it. She beganto laugh hysterically. I wanted her to cry, and she dared laughstraight in my face instead ! So I told her how my pal had made amincemeat of the two Arabs who were preparing the Molotovcocktails. He shot them down, hitting them beautifully, exactly asthey deserved. One bullet had set a Molotov cocktail on fire, withthe effect that the Arab was burning all over, just beautifully. Iwas delighted to see it.  My pal fired three bullets, two at theArab with the Molotov cocktail, and the third at his chum. It hithim straight in his ass. We both felt that we\\'d pulled offsomething.Next I told my mother how another pal of mine split open the gutsin the belly of another Arab and how all of us ran toward thatspot to take a look. I reached the spot first. And then that Arab,blood gushing forth from his body, spits at me. I yelled: \\'Shutup\\' and he dared talk back to me in Hebrew! So I just laughedstraight in his face. I am usually laughing when I stare atsomething convulsing right before my eyes. Then I told him: \\'Allright, wait a moment\\'. I left him in order to take a look atanother wounded Arab. I asked a soldier if that Arab could besaved, if the bleeding from his artery could be stopped with thehelp of a stone of something else like that. I keep telling allthis to my mother, with details, and she keeps laughing straightinto my face. This infuriated me. I got very angry, because I feltI was becoming mad. So I stopped eating, seized the plate with heomelette and some trimmings still on, and at once threw it overher head. Only then she stopped laughing. At first she didn\\'t knowwhat to say.(...) But I must tell you of a still other madness which fallsupon us frequently. I went with a friend to practice shooting on afield. A gull appeared right in the middle of the field. My friendshot it at once. Then we noticed four deer standing high up on thehill above us. My friend at once aimed at one of them and shot it.We enjoyed the sight of it falling down the rock. We shot down twodeer more and went to take a look. When we climbed the rocks wesaw a young deer, badly wounded by our bullet, but still trying tosuch some milk from its already dead mother. We carefullyinspected two paths, covered by blood and chunks of torn flesh ofthe two deer we had hit. We were just delighted by that sight. Wehad hit\\'em so good ! Then we decided to kill the young deer too,so as spare it further suffering. I approached, took out myrevolver and shot him in the head several times from a very shortdistance. When you shoot straight at the head you actually see thebullets sinking in.  But my fifth bullet made its brains falloutside onto the ground, with the effect of splattering lots ofblood straight on us. This made us feel cured of the spurt of ourmadness. Standing there soaked with blood, we felt we were likebeasts of prey. We couldn\\'t explain what had happened to us. Wewere almost in tears while walking down from that hill, and wefelt the whole day very badly.(...) We always go back to places we carried out assignments in.This is why we can see them. When you see a guy you disabled, maybe for the rest of his life, you feel you got power. You feelGodlike of sorts.\"(...) Both Danny and Dudu contemplate at least at this momentstudying the acting. Dudu is not willing to work in anysecurity-linked occupation. Danny feels the exact opposite. \\'Whyshouldn\\'t I take advantage of the skills I have mastered so well ?Why shouldn\\'t I earn $3.000 for each chopped head I would deliverwhile being a mercenary in South Africa ? This kind of job suitsme perfectly. I have no human emotions any more.

They use factory-madeammonium perchlorate composite propellants in phenolic plastic engineswith graphite nozzles. The engines are classified by impulse. A \"D\"engine, for example, can have no more than 20 newton-seconds of impulse.An \"F\" engine can have no more than 40 ns. Each letter corresponds to adoubling of the maximum impulse. So far, engines up to size \"O\" areavailable pretty much off the shelf. Engines of size H and above areshipped as Class B explosives, and as such are controlled. Engines ofsize F and below are shipped as Class C explosives, and are not ascontrolled. Class F engines, BTW, are not HPR engines, but model rocketengines.

Space ScienceDept.) on this subject, specifically on a small-scale Solar Sailproposed as a student space project. The guy giving the talk was keen togenerate interest in the project. I\\'ll typein the handout he gave out atthe meeting. Here goes : The Microlight Solar Sail-------------------------1. IntroductionThe solar sail is a well-established concept. Harnessing the pressure ofsunlight, a spacecraft would have unlimited range. In principle, such avehicle could explore the whole Solar System with zero fuel consumption.However it is more difficult to design a practical solar sail than mostpeople realize. The pressure of sunlight is only about one kilogram persquare kilometer. Deploying and controlling the large area of aluminizedfabric which would be necessary to transport a \\'conventional\\' typespacecraft is a daunting task. This is why, despite the potential of hteidea, no such craft has actually been launched to date.2.DesignRecent advances in microelectronics make possible a different concept: atiny sail just a few metres in diameter which could be controlled purelybe electronics, with no mechanical parts. Several attitude controlmethods are feasible: for example the pressure sunlight exerts on apanel of solar cells varies according to whether power is being drawn.The key components of the craft will be a minute CCD camera developed atEdinburgh University which can act as both attitude sensor and datagathering device; solar cells providing ~1 watt power for control andcommunication; and a directional radio antenna etched onto the surfaceof the sail itself. Launched as a piggyback payload, the total cost ofthe mission can be limited to a few tens of thousands of dollars.3.MissionsThe craft would be capable of some ambitious missions. For example:a) It could rendezvous with a nearby asteroid from the Apollo or Amorgroups. Closeup pictures could be transmitted back to Earth at a low bitrate.b) It could be steered into a lunar polar orbit. Previously unobservedareas around the lunar poles could be viewed. By angling the sail toreflect sunlight downwards, polar craters whose bases never receivesunlight could be imaged. Bright reflections would confirm thatvolatiles such as water ice have become trapped in theselocations.[Immensely valuable information for setting up a manned lunarbase, BTW]c) It could be sent to rendezvous with a small asteroid or cometnucleus. Impacting at low speed, a thin wire probe attached to the craftcauses it to rebound while capturing a tiny sample is a sharp-edgedtube, like performing a biopsy. Returning to Earth, the sail acts as anideal re-entry parachute: load per unit area 20 gm/m2 ensures that heatis reradiated so efectively that the sail temperature cannot exceed ~300deg C. The material sample is recovered, enclosed in a small insulatingcontainer.Contact: Colin Jack                              Tel. 0865-200447Oxford Mathematical Designs, 131 High Street, Oxford OX1 4DH, England--------------------------------This guy would love to hear from anyone interested in this project orseeking details or anything, and would be most happy to send you moreinformation.Andy--                                   ----------------------------------- Andy Jonathan J.

Either they are believing and living (in at least some part) led by God, else they are not.  Believing (intellectually, but waiting(?)) is not enough.

Take the body, and ifthey get one shot and beat you fine. Don't give them another chance. Carkner,Galley and McGill are all terrible about this, I'll bet money at least one ofthem was the closest FLYER to the play.That's all I have, my radio got bad after that and I was lucky to know who itwas that scored, much less how.From what I heard, Roussel had a very strong game. After the game, Gene Hartasked Bobby Taylor to pick the three stars of the season rather than of thegame. It was Garry Galley #3 for his career high point total (I'm surprisedthat a former goalie wouldn't look closer at his defensive play), Tommy Soderstrom #2 for his team record tying 5 shutouts in only about 1/2 a seasonand, Mark Recchi #1 for his all time high team single season scoring mark.But here's the odd part. He couldn't decide between Lindros and Recchi fornumber 1. If he picks Recchi as #1 after he had a hard time choosing betweenhim and Lindros, doesn't that make Lindros #2????What? You wanna know my three stars of the season? Well, since you asked...#1 Eric Lindros. Eric dominates a game simply by stepping out onto the ice.The difference between the team's record with him and without him is noaccident. I believe that the team could have been almost as successful withoutRecchi. There is no question that this team is significantly better with EricLindros on it, and I think that he will deservedly wear the 'C' on his jerseynext season.#2 Tommy Soderstrom. 5 shutouts was second in the league to only Ed Belfour,and Tommy didn't have a Chris Chelios (booo) in front of him. He also didn'tplay a complete season due to heart problems (sentimental edge here, my familyhas a history of heart problems). There's no question in my mind that TommySoderstrom is this teams goalie of the future, and if Roussel complains againabout being number 2 look for him to be traded within 2 years.#3 Mark Recchi. Again, you can't argue with an all-time team high single seasonscoring mark. There are an awful lot of teams that didn't have a single playerget as many points. Plus, Mark is the only FLYER to play the entire season.Not a tough choice.Honorable mentions: Rod Brind'Amour topped his single season high point totalwhich he set last year. The difference was that he wasn't on the top linethis year and didn't get as much playing time. Then again, he didn't get thedefensive attention that he got last year from the other team either.Dimtri Yushkevich was the teams most consistent defenseman. Yes, he made rookiemistakes, but he was usually fast enough to make up for them. I have a feelingthat with his shot he'll score a few more points next year without giving upanything in his own zone, and I suspect that he'll be the teams top defensemanin years to come.Garry Galley was the team's point leader from defensemen. Again, there are somethings you just can't argue with. And he battled with chronic fatigue syndrome,he certainly deserves kudos for only missing one game, and that was against hiswishes under doctors orders. But his defensive play often negates his offensivecontribution. A little more caution, and a little bit smarter in his own endwill make him a much more important part of the team next year.Brent Fedyk was the leagues biggest improvement over last years point total.But consistency became a problem for him.A couple misc notes mostly for mailing list members:Tom Misnik, a member of the mailing list, would like to exchange E-mailaddresses with any list members who want to keep in touch over the summer.If you're interested, you can send him mail at:att!ACR.ORG!TMISNIKThe FLYERS end the season 1 game below .500 in 5th place, their best winningpercentage since going .500 in 1988-89. 14-20-3 within the division (4th inPatrick), 23-14-5 at home. They finished 17th overall, will draft 10th innext years entry draft (Quebec had the 1st rounder, though).

Thanks for your assistance.Outbreaks of a chronic-mono-like entity were originally called EBS (orsome variant thereof) because most of the people with this disease hadelevated levels of antibodies to the EBV virus. But not all of themdid, which prompted an official renaming of the disease to ChronicFatigue Syndrome (this renaming took place in the Annals of InternalMedicine, Jan. 1988, I believe). Now it\\'s also called Chronic Fatigueand Immune Dysfunction Syndrome (CFIDS), since it seems clear thatsome sort of immune disregulation is causing the probs.Astonishly, there are still docs who tell people with massivelyswollen glands, recurrent fevers and nightsweats, etc., that there\\'snothing wrong with them. This is not the same thing as saying that thesyndrome may have a (at least partly) psychological cause. Thedisagreement among people whose thoughts are worth considering centerson just what the cause is. No one knows, but theories include:psychological stress, some sort of virus (a retrovirus, say most --maybe one of the newly discovered herpes viruses), environmentaltoxins, bacteria (and, yes, candida), genes, (and/)or some combo ofthese.There\\'s no outright cure at the moment, but different docs trydifferent things, some of which seem to help.Massive amounts of info on the condition are available these days.Post your Q to alt.med.cfs, and you will be flooded w/facts.Note: There are lots of far better understood (and better treatable)diseases that look like CFIDS.

I playedElvira I & II, and think that Horrorsoft has finally madea very playable game with Waxworks.  The look and feel isroughly the same as in the Elvira games, though the real timefighting is a little easier to survive.  The first two games,especially Elvira II: Jaws of Cerberus made it very tough tostay alive and hit-point restoring was very difficult.  This is not to say that Waxworks is a walk in the park, but it isquite fair, in that there is always some weapon to be foundthat is quite effective, or hint given as to the proper fightingstrategy.  In one of the four wax works to be explored, there is no fighting at all (well almost none), though all four containmoderately challanging puzzles.The really interesting thing about this game is that it is really broken up into four seperate RPGs, one for each of the four exhibitsyou must enter.  In starting each one, your character is transportedwith no objects to use, and experience level 1.  One exhibits trapsyou inside a multi-level ancient Egyptian pyramid which you must escape by fighting, mapping and puzzle solving.  Another exhibittraps you in a mine that has been taken over by creeping plant vinesand pods, while the local humans have been transformed into plantzombies.  This is a single level maze that requires you to rescuesome humans, kill the head plant alien, and figuere out how to killthe very tuff plant zombies that are always showing up.  This isperhaps the most horrifying exhibit.  Another exhibit puts you intoJack The Ripper England where you appear by the corpse of a fresh Rippervictim, and of course the police think you are responsible.  You mustavoid police and angry mobs to unravel the mystery of The Ripper and meet him face to face - but first get a disquise.  The last exhibitpus you in a graveyard where most of the challenge is in learning to stop the almost indestructible zombies.  Over all the VGA graphics and music are very effective in setting a creepy tone for the game, as was the case for the Elvira games, thoughgameplay is much improved and makes for a much more enjoyable game.I heartily recommend it for RPG and Horror fans.   *********************************************************- All prices include shipping.- All games are in excellent condition unless otherwise stated.- US buyers only please.- All games will be shipped inside a box with packing, insured,  priority USPS.- All games include all original materials including box, manual,  disks, and registration unless otherwise noted.The first responder offering asking price is guarenteed toget the game.

The SK theater. They were showing an Argentinian film, \"The Abyss.\" Before the film we noticed about 60 to 70 people standing near the podium at the City Party Committee, but they were silent, there\\'s no conversation whatsoever, and we couldn\\'t figure out what was going on. That is, we knew it was about Karabagh, but what it was exactly, what they were talking about, if someone gave a speech or not, we didn\\'t know. We bought our tickets. There were 30 or 40 people in the theater. This was a very small number for that large movie theater. The film started. About 30 minutes later they stopped thefilm. A crowd burst in. About 60 people. They came up onto the stage. Well mostly they were young people, from 16 to 23 years old. They demanded that an Armenian woman come up onto the stage. They used foul language and said that they were going to show what Azerbaijanis were capable of, what they could do to Armenian girls. I thought that\\'s what they meant because they had demanded a girl specifically. Marina and I were sitting together. I told her to move over, there were some Russian girls sitting nearby. So that if someone recognized me or if something happened, they would take me, and not Marina. It got quiet, 2 or 3 girls jumped up to run out, but the door was closed--it\\'sonly opened at the end of the   show--and they returned to their seats. Everyone in the theater was looking at one another, Russians, Azerbaijanis, people of various nationalities. But no one reacted at all, no one in the auditorium made a sound. They were silent, looking at one another, and gradually started to leave. Some guy, a really fat one, says, \"OK, we\\'ve scared them enough, let\\'s leave.\" They leave slowly, pompously. It seemed to me that those people were not themselves. Either they had smoked a bunch of \"anasha\", or had taken something else, because they all looked beastly, like they were ready to tear anyone apart. Then it was all over, as though nothing had happened at all. The film started up again, it was one of those cheerful films which should have only brought pleasure, made you happy to be alive. We could barely sit to the end. So it had started at seven it was over by nine, and it was dark . . .Marina and I were walking home, Lenin Street, that\\'s the center of town. LeninStreet was packed, just packed with young people. They were shouting, something about Karabagh and something about Armenians. We weren\\'t especially listening, because the way we were feeling we didn\\'t know if we were going to make it home or not, and just what had happened anyway? Public transportation wasn\\'t running. Incidentally, when we came out of the theater we saw police, policemen standing there. The director of the movie theater was looking at thedoors, because when they were leaving they had broken the glass, the doors there are basically all glass. Everything was broken. He stood there grief-stricken, but looking as though nothing really big had happened, like some naughty boys had just broken them quite by accident, with a slingshot. Well, since he looked more or less calm I decided that, nothing all that super serious had happened. We went out very slowly; we wanted to catch a bus, we live literally one stop away. We didn\\'t want to go on foot, not because it wasdark, but because something might happen. We flagged down a cab, but the driver didn\\'t want to take us. We told him we live near the bus station, and he said he\\'d take us to the bus station and not a yard farther. I said, well, OK . . .So we got into the cab and managed to get there. Something incredible was happening at the bus station. There was a traffic jam. Public transportation was at a standstill and everyone was shouting \"Ka-ra-bagh,\" they\\'re not going to give up Karabagh. I go home and tell my family what\\'s going on, and there\\'simmediate panic in the house. Mamma says, what should we do? Like the end had come, they were going to come, kill us, that\\'s it . . . Somehow we managed to cheer ourselves up: Nothing that bad could happen. Where are we living anyway,just what kind of social order do we have? Somehow we manage to calm Mamma down. And we went to bed. But no one could sleep. Everyone made as though nothing had happened.That was on Saturday. In short, the day went by. We didn\\'t go anywhere and didn\\'t call our relatives. No one did anything. Because . . . life goes on.That day I realized something was approaching, but what exactly, I couldn\\'tguess.On the 28th everything was like it was supposed to be, we lived like we alwayshad. There were five of us at home: Mamma, Papa and us, three sisters: Lyuda, Marina, and I. My sister Lyuda was in Yerevan at the time. We sat at home and no one went out. Later we learned that a demonstration had started that morning. It all started . . . They were smashing up stores. We were sitting athome and didn\\'t know anything about it. Then a girlfriend of mine, Lyuda Zimogliad, came by at around three o\\'clock I think. We worked together, we didour apprenticeships together, she\\'s a Russian girl. She said that somethingawful was happening in town. I asked, \"Don\\'t they want Armenians? Well what are they after, if they\\'re already in that state?\" She says, no, nothing like that, it\\'s just a demonstration, but it\\'s awful to watch it. Somehow, it feelslike a war has broken out. Public transportation has been stopped . . . The cabs, the buses, well it\\'s just a nightmare.Then Papa decides to go to the drugstore, my mother was having allergy problems at the time . . . He left the house and our neighbor, Aunt Vera,asked him, \"Where are you going? Stop! There are such terrible things goingon in the courtyard; aren\\'t you afraid to go out?\" Papa didn\\'t know what shewas talking about. She simply pushed him back into the entryway. He came home and told Mamma. Mamma said, \"Well, if Aunt Vera was talking like that it meansthat something is really going on.\" But we didn\\'t go see her, she\\'s a Russian,she lives across from us. I had to see my friend out. Around five o\\'clock I tell Lyuda, \"Ok, look, it\\'s time for you to go, it\\'s late already, I\\'ll see you out.\" Mamma says, \"You don\\'t need to go, it\\'s too late already, you can see what the situation in town is.\" So we decided to stay home. Dinner was ready. Mamma says, \"Let her eat with us, then she can go.\" We sat down at the table. But no one was hungry, no one was in the mood, we just put everything out on the table to calm ourselves down, and make it appear that we\\'re eating.We turned on the television, and the show \"In Fairy-Tale Land\" was coming on. We cleared the table.We hear some noise out in the courtyard. I go out on the balcony, but I can\\'t see what\\'s going on, because the noise is coming from the direction of the busstation, and there is a 9-story building in the way. There is mob of people . . . I can\\'t figure out what\\'s happening. They\\'re shouting something, lookingsomewhere, I can\\'t make out what is going on. I go down to a neighbor, she\\'s an Azerbaijani; we\\'ve been friends of her family for about 25 years. I go downto look from their place. I see people shouting, looking at the 5-and 9-story buildings near the bus station. Just then soldiers set upon them, about 20 people, with clubs. The mob runs off in different directions. I even see several people from our building. They are looking and laughing . . . I decidethat means it\\'s not all that bad if they are laughing: it means they\\'re not killing anyone. But now the crowd suddenly dashes toward the soldiers. One of the soldiers cannot manage to get away, they start stomping on him with their feet, everyone\\'s kicking him . . . I become ill and go home, and explain in general terms that horrible things are going on out there . . .  can\\'t speak. . . Well, they\\'ve probably killed that soldier, the way that crowd is . . .If each of them kicked him just once . . . They took his club away from himand started to beat him with it. But it was far away and I couldn\\'t see if hegot up and left or not.I become terrified and go home and say, \"Lyuda, don\\'t go anywhere, stay at ourplace, because if you go out they could kill you or . . . \" Then the crowd runs over closer toward our building and stands at the 12-story building and starts shouting something. We go out onto the balcony. All of our neighbors are also out on theirs, too. Everyone is standing, staring. The mob is shouting and about 5 minutes later comes running toward our building. As it turns out, at the 12-story building the Azerbaijani neighbors went down and kept them from coming in. There\\'s only one entryway there, they could stop them.They all run up to our building. Mamma immediately starts closing the windows,afraid that they might throw stones. They have stones and they break the windows, all of them. There are very many people. We have a large courtyard, and it\\'s packed with people. They spill up to the first floor so they don\\'t crush each other. They crawl up on trees, posts, and garages. It\\'s just a hugecloud of people. They break and burn the motorcycle of the Armenian Sergey Sargisian, from our building. We close the windows and immediately hear tramping in our entryway. They come up to our fifth floor with a tremendous din and roar. It\\'s incomprehensible. Mamma told me later that they were shouting Father\\'s name, \"Grisha, open the door, we\\'ve come to kill you!,\" orsomething like that. I don\\'t remember that, I was spaced out, kind of. Mamma says, \"Into the bedroom, quickly!\" In the bedroom we have two tall beds, part of our dowry; Mamma says, \"Hide there, they probably won\\'t come in there, they\\'ll ask something, say something, and leave.\" She says, \"We\\'ll tell them that we live alone here.\" I can\\'t imagine that my parents will stand out in the hall alone talking with some sort of beasts . . . I go to them and say that I\\'ll stand together with them, I\\'ll talk with them if they come, maybe I can find a common language with them, all the more so if they know me: I speak Azerbaijani more or less, and I can find out what they want. I told Marina andLyuda to hide under the bed, and my sister Lyuda, I can\\'t remember if I told her anything or not.Then . . . they open the door: it\\'s like they blew on it and it broke and fellright into the hall. The crows bursts in and starts to shout: Get out of here,leave, vacate the apartment and go back to your Armenia; things like that. Itell them, \"What has happened, speak calmly. One of you, tell me, calmly, whathas happened.\" In Azerbaijani, they say, \"Get out of the apartment, leave.\" I say, \"OK. Go downstairs. We\\'ll gather everything we need and leave the apartment.\" I realize that it is senseless to discuss any sort of rights withthem, these are animals. They must be stopped. The ones standing in thedoorway, the young guys, say, \"There are old people and one girl with them.Too bad!\" They take two or three steps back. It seems as though I havepacified them with our exchange. Then someone in the courtyard shouts, commanding them: \"Don\\'t you understand what you are saying? Kill them?\"And that was it! That was all it took. They grab Papa, carry him into oneroom, and Mamma and me into another. They put Mamma on the bed and start undressing her, beating her legs. They start tearing my clothes, right there, in front of Mamma. I don\\'t remember where they went, what they did, or how much time passed. I had the feeling that they beat me on the head, on my body,and tore my clothes, all at the same time, I don\\'t even know what I said. The atrocities started. I was savagely raped in that room. They argued among themselves who would go first.Later, I remember, I came to. I don\\'t know if I\\'m dead or alive. Someone comesin, someone tall, I think, clean-shaven, in an Eskimo dogskin coat, balding. He looks around at what\\'s happening. At that instant everything stops. It seems to me that he is either their commander or . . . that somehow everythingdepends on him. He looks and says, \"Well, we\\'re done here.\" They are beatingMamma on the head. They break up the chairs and beat her with the chair legs . . . She loses consciousness, and they decide that she\\'s dead. Papa . . . wasout cold. They want to throw Lyuda off the balcony, but they can\\'t get the window open. Apparently the window frames are stuck after the rain and the windows can\\'t be opened. They leave her next to the window. She was thinking about being thrown out the window and passed out. She\\'s not a real strong person anyway . . . He looks at me and sees that I\\'m saying something, thatI\\'m still twitching. Well, I start saying the opposite of what I should be, which is humbling myself and pleading. I start shouting, cursing . . . they don\\'t get any entreaty out of me. I  already know that I\\'m dead, why would I humble myself before anyone? And he says that if that\\'s what I think, since mytongue is so long . . . maybe he thinks that I still look quite appealing . . . In short, he commands that I be taken outside.I no longer saw or remembered what was happening to Marina and Lyuda, I don\\'t know if they are alive or not. They take me outside. They are dragging me by my arms, by my legs. They are hitting me against the wall, the railings, something metal . . . While they are carrying me someone is biting me, someoneelse is pinching me . . .I don\\'t even know. I think, my God, when will death come? If only it were sooner . . . Then . . . they carry me out, throw me nearthe entryway . . . and start kicking me. I lose consciousness . . . What happened after that, how many people there were, I don\\'t remember. I come to after a while, I don\\'t remember how long. A neighbor is bringing me clothing. I\\'m entirely covered with blood, she puts a dress on me. I remember that I said the same words over and over again: \"Mamma, what happened, Mamma, what have they done to us, where are we, whose house are we at?\" I can\\'t make sense out of anything. There is a guy standing over me, I sort of know him, heserved in Afghanistan, his name is Igor, he brought me indoors. When they all went to the third entryway and killed a person there, Igor gathered his courage, took me into his arms, and brought me to the neighbors\\', even though he\\'s small-minded, he put himself at risk. Igor Agayev is Azerbaijani; he served in Afghanistan. There are three brothers. The older brother also servedthere, I think; now he\\'s stationed here, on the border, in Armenia. Igor brought me to the neighbors\\', and then helped me come to my senses, saying, \"Karina, I know you, calm down, I\\'m not one of them.\" How do I know who\\'s who and what\\'s what? I come to, and they clean me up. I was covered in blood. ThenPapa . . . I saw Papa, I saw Mamma. And Marina, too . . . Igor was there when they dragged Marina and Lyuda out from under the bed . . . Marina . . . Lyuda said that she was Russian, they said, we\\'ll let you go, we aren\\'t touching theRussians, go. And while they are dragging Marina out she decides she\\'s going to tell them she\\'s Azerbaijani. Igor immediately grabs Marina\\'s and Lyuda\\'s hands, because he knows Marina, and knows that she is Armenian and is our sister, and takes her to the second floor to a neighbor\\'s and starts pounding on the door so she will open up. She opens the door and Igor pushes them in there. So they survived.My sister Lyuda lost consciousness after the bandits started stealing things.While they were going downstairs, taking things downstairs, then coming back up again, Lyuda seized the opportunity and crawled under the bed and stayed there. Then, when she was herself again, she found a torn night shirt and put it on, and some sort of robe and went to a neighbor\\'s on the fourth floor, theone whose apartment I had watched the crowd from, the friend of ours, and knocked on the door. The neighbor opened and said, \"I\\'m not going to let you in the apartment because I\\'m afraid of them. But I\\'ll give you some stockings and we\\'ll leave the building.\" Lyuda says, \"I\\'ll stay at your place because ofwhat\\'s going on, they keep going up and down the stairs.\" It was just for a moment, just a moment in life, but the neighbor wouldn\\'t consent. Lyuda came back to our place and lay under the bed . . .I came to. Mother was there. I can\\'t remember my supervisor\\'s telephone number, but something had to be done. Somehow I remembered and called, and he came to get us. He didn\\'t have any idea what was going on. He thought we were simply afraid, he didn\\'t know that they were killing us and that we had passedbetween life and death. He came and got us and took us to the police precinct.There they looked us over. I was having trouble walking, my lungs hurt badly, it was hard to breathe . . .My supervisor\\'s name is Urshan Feyruzovich Mamedov. He\\'s the head of our administration. They took us there. When we were leaving, I saw a great numberof buses full of soldiers at the entrance to town. The buses were ordinary passenger buses. There were very many soldiers. We left around eleven, right after eleven. If these people could stop what was happening they could save a great many lives . . . Because the crowd was moving on, toward the school, andwhat was going on there . . . I think everyone know not only in Sumgait, not only in Yerevan. Because there they murdered them all one after the next, without stopping. After us.I think 14 people died in Microdistrict No. 3, and 10 to 12 of them were fromBuildings 4, 5, and 6. In our building one person died, and one old woman diedfrom Building 16, that\\'s the building in front of ours. There young Azerbaijani men stopped the mob and wouldn\\'t let it into their building. Incidentally, when we were at the neighbors\\', Marina called our relativesto warn them, so they would all know what was happening. I called a aunt in Microdistrict No. 5. They have three neighbors who are Armenians. I said, \"Runquickly, I can\\'t explain what\\'s going on; hide, do what you can, just stayalive. Hide at Azerbaijanis\\', ones who won\\'t give you away.\" At that moment three people came in, policemen. I think they were Azerbaijanis. I was in suchawful condition, my face was completely distorted my lips were puffed up, there was blood, my eye was swollen, no one thought I would ever see anything out of that eye again . . . my forehead was badly cut, and one-half of my facewas pushed out forward. No one would have thought that I would survive, get mynormal appearance back, and be able to grasp anything at all. I started to scream at those people, why did you come, who sent you here, no one wants you here, haven\\'t you killed people people yet, what are you doing here? One of the soldiers said, \"Don\\'t scream at us. We\\'re Muslims, but we\\'re not from the Sumgait police. They called in from Daghestan.\" So at that point the Daghestan police were there.When we got to the police precinct there were an awful lot of police there,there were soldiers, police with dogs, ambulances, firemen . . . I don\\'t know,maybe they were waiting for people to bring them the goners and the seriously injured to treat them there in the police precinct. I don\\'t know what they were there for. There were also doctors from Baku there. They examined Lyuda and me and said, \"These women need to go to the Maternity Home, but we don\\'t know what to do with the rest.\"So they took us, and I lost contact with my parents, my boss, everyone. My boss said, \"Don\\'t worry, I\\'ll find you, no matter where you are, no matterwhat happens.\" We went to the hospital. There we were examined by a departmenthead from the Sumgait Maternity Home, Pashayeva, I think her name was. She examined us. The ambulance was from Baku; I figured out that the Sumgait ambulances hadn\\'t done anything, they didn\\'t respond to any calls. People called and neither the police nor the ambulances showed any sign of life.That doctor looked me over and I could tell from her behavior that somethingvery good had happened, for she became quite glad. I even thought to myself, \"God, can it be that nothing all that bad is wrong?\" She looks me over and says, \"Now why are you suffering so? You don\\'t know what your people have beendoing, your people did even worse things.\" And I think, great, I have to deal with her . . . And I felt so bad, I thought, why don\\'t I just die so as not tohave to hear more stuff like this from people like her? Here I am in this condition and being told about something that our people did. I just didn\\'t have the energy to say, \"How could our people possibly be smart enough to think of something that yours haven\\'t already done?\" I stayed there. Then theybrought in another woman, Ira B., she was married, and she was raped in her own apartment, too. There were three of us, Ira, Lyuda, and 1. The next morning they took Lyuda and Ira away. They didn\\'t do anything to help us. Thiswas in the old Maternity Home, in the combined block. They didn\\'t do anything more than examine me, that was it. I didn\\'t want any shots or tranquilizer, nothing. What shots could have calmed me down? I didn\\'t even want to look at them.I lay in the ward. Either it just worked out that way or they did it on pur-pose, but I was alone. I was alone even though the wards were packed. Thatsame evening a woman came by and asked me what was wrong with me, that my facewas disfigured. She asked what had happened to me, and I said, \"Better to ask your brother what happened, there\\'s no point in asking me, your brother can better explain what happened.\" She fell into a faint. All the doctors threw themselves at her, and the doctor categorically forbade anyone to come into myward.Then people from work came to see me, my boss, his daughter; they brought me clothing, because I was literally naked. The only thing I had on was a dress, but the woman who gave it to me was very short, and the dress was way up above my knees, and the woman orderly said, \"I can\\'t believe you put on such ashort dress, who are you showing off your legs to here?\" I went back to my ward thinking, just one more thing from something. People from work came and brought me something in a sack, apples, I think, three or four pounds, but I couldn\\'t take them. I had become so weak that it was just embarrassing. I saidthat I couldn\\'t take the apples, and really didn\\'t have any appetite. No one had to bring me anything. Some woman took the sack . . . And, oh yes! . . . Then I heard that the head doctor tell a nurse that my medical history should be hidden or torn up completely so that no one would know that I was an Armenian, maybe they wouldn\\'t figure it out from looking at me. So they must have been thinking that there would be some kind of attack, that something else would happen. That it would be worse. Or, perhaps, someone was outside onthe street, I don\\'t know. In any case, I didn\\'t sleep a wink that night.The next morning they picked me up, a whole police detail, put me in a bus, and off we went. I didn\\'t even know where they were taking me. They took me tothe club where the troops were, the very one I was in that ill-fated evening.I got off the bus. Near the City Party Committee there were a great many troops, tanks, armored personnel carriers; the whole scene was terrible. I saw a few people I knew there, and that calmed me a little. I had already thought that I was the only one left. So there were five or six of us left in Sumgait after that night. I still didn\\'t know what happened to my parents, they didn\\'t come to see me in the hospital, and my boss told me that everything was fine. I didn\\'t know whether to believe him or not. Maybe he was just trying to calm me down, maybe something happened on the way. Then I went to the club and saw a lot of people I knew. They all knew one another, they were all kissing each other and asking, \"What happened, what went on?\" Two days later they came to see me from work. They were there all the time. Each day they came, showed interest, and were constantly bringing me money. They did everything they could. Of course I\\'m most thankful to my boss, the only one of my colleagues who didn\\'t lose his presence of mind and who didn\\'t change his opinions, neither before, nor after, nor in the heat of the moment, no matter what happened. He constantly took an interest. A sincere interest, from the heart . . . Then, about two days later, the secretary of the Party Committee came, not from our Party organization, but from the First Trust, which ours is part of, Comrade Kerimov, a very important figure in our town. He made arrangementswith the emergency medical personnel to take me away, because if I sat down bymyself I couldn\\'t get up or lie down again. There was something wrong with mylungs, it was hard to breathe. They examined me there several times, there I lay were several doctors, they all thought that . . . that it must just be from all the blows, I don\\'t know. They didn\\'t diagnose anything in particular.When I was in the Maternity Home I even asked . . . I made it a point of insisting that they take me to the trauma section because I felt so awful. There was no way something inside wasn\\'t broken, my ribs . . . Well they took me there and took x-rays and said that everything was fine. There were emergency medical workers on duty in the club. The mother of one of Marina\\'s friends was there. She was the head doctor at the Sumgait Children\\'s Clinic. They had every kind of antifever agent in the world, which was exactly what Ineeded at that moment, I thought. I said that I was having great difficultybreathing, I couldn\\'t seem to get enough air, something was wrong with me.They put tight bandages around my chest and waist. Later I overheard somepeople saying that I had been cut all over. I think they just saw me being allbandaged up and decided that my breasts and face had been cut . . . But Iwasn\\'t cut.They took us to the Khimik boarding house. We lived there a long time. Soon appeared representatives . . . They were agitating. At first people would not talk to them, and drove them off. One of the Armenian women shouted, \"We demand that Seidov come!\" The response was, \"It\\'s Seidov who sent us.\" Seidov is the Chairman of the Azerbaijani Council of Ministers. The woman said, \"We\\'ll only see Seidov\\'s daughter, have her come here, we\\'ll do the same things to her that they did to our daughters, and then we\\'ll deal with you agitators.\" And so on. More of them said, \"Have Seidov himself come.\" This went on day in, day out. The agitators kept coming and coming, this drove us out of our wits. Then people gradually started departing for Yerevan because they realized it was senseless to stay. Everything got on our nerves: The smell, the small children. There were children at the SK club, children who had literally just come out of the Maternity Home. What were they doing in a club that didn\\'t even have running water all the time? At first we had to pay to eat there. They even overcharged us, as it turned out. On the second day someone told us that they would bring us food for free. The children were ill.Everything stank there. Well imagine about 3,000 people in a small movie theater with seating for no more than 500. You couldn\\'t sit or lie down, it was impossible to even move. The stench was awful. Even the smallest infants took ill overnight there. I heard that they were arriving seriously ill in Yerevan, the infants. They have to be washed, they have to be bathed, not to mention that we, the adults, were ill and needed care. People were fainting right and left. I just don\\'t know, everyone was crying, everyone . . . Only the young people, the men, somehow managed to keep it together. But the women were in a constant state of panic. It seemed to everyone that they would come any minute and kill and stab. It seemed clear that we had been gathered together purposely, like during the war, so that they could burn the movie theater and there wouldn\\'t be a single Armenian left. Then people went up to the attic. I didn\\'t see them, I only heard them, because I was lying down and couldn\\'t get up. I lay right on the stage, we had some room there. Apparently they caught two people with either oil or gas. I think they wanted to burn thetheater. Maybe someone saw them, I didn\\'t. I was in no condition to open my eyes.Everyone was suspicious of everyone else. They would ask, \"Aren\\'t you an Azerbaijani? I think I saw you somewhere, I think you\\'re an Azerbaijani.\" Theyled out all the men and started letting them back in by checking theirpassports, relatives might be covering for each other. Half of the people didnot have any documents. There were people who had run out of their homes in nothing but a pair of pants and slippers, or wearing just a shirt, not likethey should have, with their IDs.So on the 28th, on Sunday, I think, the police did nothing to help us. OnMonday everything resumed where it had left off on Block 41A. They didn\\'t spare a soul there: not children, not pregnant women, nobody. They killed,they burned, they hacked with axes, just everything possible. They murdered the Melkumian family whom I knew, my mother worked with them. Their daughter-in-law went to school with my older sister. They were brutally murdered. Only the two daughters-in-law survived. By a miracle one was able to save herself, she ran away, the neighbors wouldn\\'t take her in, so she ran about the building until she found refuge. She was pregnant and had two small children. This all continued on Monday in Block 41A, on the 29th, when the troops were already in the city.They murdered people, they overturned automobiles, and they burned entire families. They say they didn\\'t even know for sure if the people were Armeniansor not. I heard that the Lezgins suffered, too. I\\'m not sure myself, I didn\\'t see any Lezgins who had been injured. They burned cars so it\\'s very difficult now to say exactly who died and who didn\\'t. It was very difficult to identify the corpses, or rather, what remained of the corpses after they were doused ingasoline and burned . . . it\\'s all very hard to imagine, of course I heard that many people disappeared without a trace, from the BTZ plant two people, including a woman who worked the night shift, Aunt Razmella, who also lived inMicrodistrict 3.They were stopping buses between Baku and Sumgait. In the evening people who had been visiting Baku were returning to Sumgait, and people from Baku were going home from Sumgait, and there were students, too. They were simply savagely murdered. They were stopping the buses, the drivers immediately did what they were told because there was just no other way to deal with that hoard of brutally minded people. They stopped the buses, dragged the Armeniansout and killed them on the spot. I didn\\'t see it myself, but I heard that theyput them all in a pile so as to burn them. Later it was hard to discern from the corpses, well you can\\'t call them corpses, you had to figure out from the ashes who it was. l heard that two fellows saved two women, one a student, IraG., if I\\'m not mistaken. She was in the hospital a long time after that, and she still can\\'t figure out who saved her. She was also brutally raped and beaten and thrown onto a pile of corpses. The fellow pulled her out of that whole pile of corpses, put his coat on her, took her into his arms, and carried her to the city. I still can\\'t imagine how he managed to do that.I heard that from Engels Grigorian. He knows her, apparently. Well a lot of people went to that hospital anyway. She was in the hospital and singing a song in Armenian, and they wrote the words down, and, I think he still has that piece of paper, because he says that a lot of people now have that song, the one she sang in the hospital where she lay in such bad shape. They couldn\\'t find the guy who saved her. He left her in someone\\'s apartment andcalled the ambulance, she was in such awful shape that, probably, like me,she couldn\\'t remember anyone\\'s face.I think that I knew one of the people who broke into our house, maybe I had talked with him once. But I received so many blows everything was just knockedout of my head. I can\\'t remember to this day who he was. Then, it seems, I sawthe Secretary of the Directorate\\'s Party organization, where Marina works. Shegoes to school and works, she goes to night school at AZI, and works by day atthe Khimzashchita Construction and Installation Administration. I\\'m the Secretary of the Komsomol organization at our administration and often met with the secretaries of Party and Komsomol organizations. We had joint meetings. I know them all, I\\'ve even talked with them, and he, I know, is fromArmenia. An Azerbaijani, but from Armenia. It became obvious that many of those people were Azerbaijanis born in Armenia.They took me to various police stations, to the police precinct, and to theProcuracy, because the USSR Procuracy got involved in the case, and I iden-tified the photographs of people who I could more or less recognize. Theyshowed me the people who were in our apartment, they\\'re working on ourcase, but I can\\'t even recognize them, although it was proved that they werethe ones, they\\'re processing it somehow. They tell me that they know thatsomeone held me by the arm and someone else held me by the leg when they were dragging me. There was someone else in our apartment who did not even touch me, he just stole a blanket and an earring or something like that. All these people, all of them, as much as I\\'ve heard about them and seen them, they wereall from Kafan.The Secretary of the Party organization is named Najaf, Najaf Rzayev. He was there when everything started. It must have been him because I didn\\'t recognize anyone else in the crowd whom I knew besides him. All the more sinceI told him, \"Listen, you do something, because you know me.\" He turned away and went toward the bedroom, where Marina was. Well you couldn\\'t see Marina anyway. There was such a noisy confusion of people that you couldn\\'t make out anyone. All of it flew right out of my head, and then gradually I became myself again, at the City Party Committee . . . There were military people there. I told them what went on, and they wrote it all down. I told them his name. On March 8 the Secretary of our First Trust Party organization, the one we\\'re part of, came to see us, his name is Najaf Rzayev. I tell Mamma, \"Ifhe\\'s here despite the fact that I gave his name, it means that either his alibi has been confirmed or, probably, that they think I\\'m crazy, not responsible for my words.\" He said, \"What did they do to you, how awful, myself, I hid an Armenian family.\" Then after some time goes by he comes back again and says something entirely different: \"I wasn\\'t at home, my family and I went to Baku.\" I said, \"Marina, what is he saying? He said something totallydifferent before.\" After that I didn\\'t go to see our Procurator, our case is being handled by a procurator from Voronezh, Fedorov by name. Fedorov told me that Rzayev\\'s case had just gotten to him, and there were so names involved. What are they doing with Rzayev?Did he prove his alibi or not? They just think that since I was hit in the head I can\\'t say anything for sure, whether it was him or not. It will be an insult if he was in our apartment and doesn\\'t have to pay for it, but at the same timeI\\'m afraid to say I\\'m a hundred percent sure that it was he. Because no mat-ter who I name, they tell me, no, you\\'re wrong, he didn\\'t do that, that onewasn\\'t there. All the faces have gotten mixed up in my mind. Who did whatexactly I can\\'t say.                                                     When they took me outside there was a whole crowd there, but I didn\\'t see it, because I had my eyes closed all the time. It seemed to me that I always gotit because of my eyes, people were always hassling me, for some reason it always seemed to me that my eyes are responsible. When they were beating my face I thought they were trying to put my eyes out. So I had my eyes closed, they took me outside and started to beat me. A young guy, 22, held my arms, heworks at the BTZ plant. And right nearby, across the road from us, Block 41, is where all this was going on. Right across the road from us. The BTZ dormitory is over there, that\\'s where he lives. Now he\\'s in custody, they evenhave proved, as far as I know, that it was he who killed Shurik Gambarian, theclarinet player from the third entryway of our building. One person in our building was killed, it was that man.A guy comes by who shared a room with the guy who was holding me. He saw thathe was holding me by the arms and that he was beating me, but he didn\\'t come over, he just looked and then went into the dormitory. A while after it was all over, people started making announcements in town saying that investigators had been summoned. That guy went and told them everything. Now they\\'ve caught him, everything\\'s been proved. Now, evidently, they\\'ve beenbeating him, I don\\'t know what they\\'re doing with them over there, but he himself said that he was working the night shift at the plant. Some young guy came to the plant and said, \"Everyone who wants to kill Armenians come to the bus station on Saturday at ten.\" That was it. He said, the ones who wanted to,went. This was at the BTZ plant, during the night shift, probably, late Fridaynight. It was at night, they were at the sauna together. And he said, what do you mean, do you understand what you are saying? The others were silent, probably, in their hearts they were thinking, I\\'m going to go. But they didn\\'tsay anything to one another. He said that he thought it important to to go, because he had heard a lot about what had happened in Kafan, that they had killed their Azerbaijani sisters, their mothers, burned villages, and all of that. That guy was also born in Kafan. That is certain. And Marina says that the Secretary of the Party organization is from Armenia, too.                                                             fromI\\'ve participated in the investigation a couple of times. I\\'m satisfied withthem thus far. They summoned us and asked about what happened, and every word I said was recorded. I met some guy there . . . By the way, he was an Armenian. I said that he was in our apartment, but what he did, I don\\'t know. His last name was Grigorian, Eduard Grigorian. He s from Sumgait, from Microdistrict 1. He was sentenced I think, to five years, not his first time. His mother is Russian. I met with him at the KGB in Baku, at the Azerbaijani KGB. They took us there and showed me photographs. There were so many photographs, I think they even photographed those people who were caught at curfew, and I\\'ve got them all confused. I say, the face was about like this, the guy in the white coat with the red clasps. But he could take that coat offand burn it somewhere, and it would be like looking for a needle in a haystack. Well. This guy, Grigorian, I said, he was in our apartment, but he is so light-complected that he looks like a Lezgin. I don\\'t know what he did, I can\\'t remember. Maybe he beat me or raped me. But he was in our apartment. At the KGB he started asking me, pleading with me, there\\'s no need for this, all this stuff, look me in the eyes, you\\'re like a sister to me. I took a lookat him and thought, \"My God, Heaven forbid that I should have a brother like you.\" But they were satisfied with my responses, because I said everything without great certainty. I was there with Mamma. Then Lyuda came in, but when she came in she got sick immediately. She wanted to kill him, she crawled overthe table at him. She recognized him. When she came to, Lyuda was lying on thebalcony, the mob threw her there and all of them ran into the bedroom. We had all kinds of boxes with dishes in them, the dowries for all three sisters. They stole everything in the apartment, leaving only small things. At that moment Lyuda came to and started remembering everything. Well, seeing the faces, hearing the voices . . . Two people were saying they could burn the apartment. Another says, why burn the apartment when I\\'ve got three kids and no place to live. So this guy was in temporary housing, he didn\\'t have anywhere to live, he was from Sumgait. They were sure that they would get the apartment. Besides, the neighbors were Azerbaijani. Why should they burn the apartment, they might burn Azerbaijanis. That\\'s what they said. How did they know there were Azerbaijanis there, if they just picked a place, thinking thatArmenians lived there? We have a list of the residents for our part of the building, our name is in there, but how could they know that Azerbaijanis lived on the other side of the wall from us? So they didn\\'t set fire to our apartment.I don\\'t know, I was in such bad shape that if all of it had come to a halt when I was outside, if someone had asked me what was happening, I wouldhave said that a civil war was going on. Well, maybe not civil . . . butprobably civil, because when they were beating me I opened my eyes and sawthat all the neighbors were standing on their balconies and watching, like ata free horror film. So a civil war was going on, and only the Armenians werebeing fought. If it were a world war or something like that, they would havebeen fighting everyone. But they only fought us. Then I met some women from our building, some Azerbaijanis. They are crying, they tell me, \"Karina, we saw all of it, how could it happen?\" They\\'re asking me! Well I just don\\'t knowwhat to call it if a normal girl can stand there and watch what happened to me. I think that if it were the other way around either I wouldn\\'t have been able to take it, or I would have tried to avert it, like that one Azerbaijani woman did in front of our building. A woman lives there, an awful, dissipated woman, if you can call her a woman, the dissipated life she leads. Two Armenian families live there, in her part of the building. She came out on thebalcony and saw what was happening to me and started to scream and curse. She came down to the entryway and said, \"You\\'ll come in this entryway over my deadbody.\" So not one of them took it in his head to go in that entryway. Some folks were saying that those people were so out of control that they didn\\'t even know what they were doing. I don\\'t think that\\'s true. They knew very wellwhat they were doing if they didn\\'t even lift a hand against that woman. They couldn\\'t have cared less about her, but the fact that she was an Azerbaijani stopped them.They were just beasts, they had smoked so much. When they came to our place they were all chewing something. I noticed: Everyone who came into the apartment was chewing something. I think, my God, maybe I just think that? Maybe I\\'m losing my mind? But no, they\\'re all chewing something. Maybe it is some kind of drug, it must be, because . . . At first glance they all seemed to be such normal people, young, clean-shaven, looking exactly as if they had come to some sort of celebration. But they were shouting something. Theydidn\\'t talk, they shouted, as though there were deaf people there. They screamed and screamed: \"Yeah, killing, killing, we\\'re killing the Armenians!\" Only they didn\\'t shout \"kill,\" they shouted \"gurun ermianlary.\" Gurun literally means \"kill,\" or \"destroy.\"That\\'s how it was! I\\'ll continue. We hid in a captain\\'s apartment, he\\'s anAzerbaijani, his wife is a Tatar. We were sitting in their apartment, their kids were out in the yard. Their kids knew a whole lot. This was in our part of the building, on the third floor. When Mamma came to and couldn\\'t findLyuda she took Papa\\'s hand, this was while the looters were stealing things,but they didn\\'t pay attention because they were stealing things. Apparentlythey had already ceased killing and switched to stealing. Mamma found thecourage to . . .A boy said to my mother \"Where\\'s the gold?\" Mamma said he must have been 12 to 14 years old. He even looked Russian, he was so fair-skinned. But the Azerbaijanis from Armenia are fair-skinned. I noticed they were all on the fair side. He shouted, they were all smashing things, and he asks Mamma where the gold is. We kept our gold in the wardrobe with our important papers. In a little black bag, we kept everything in there. Mamma doesn\\'t really like to wear gold. She probably never even wore those things from the time they were bought for her. They took everything that was lying on the cheval glass. Mammathinks that the gold saved us. Because they threw themselves at the gold, and Mamma grabbed Papa, who was trying to breathe. They had closed his mouth, bound his hands, and put a pillow and a chair on his face . . . They had shoved something into his mouth so he would suffocate. Mamma grabbed him and tore all that stuff off . . . He had something in his mouth, he was having trouble breathing, his nose was filled with blood. Mamma grabbed him and started running from the fifth down to the first floor because no one wanted to open their doors to them. Mamma said that by accident, completely by accident that person opened his door, he was sleeping, and said, half-awake, \"What\\'s happened?\" He sees that they are bloody. Mamma said, \"At least go and find out what\\'s happening to my daughters, even if they\\'ve burned them or murdered them, at least bring the corpses.\" He went looking for us. At that moment Lyuda was under the bed. She says that after they left it seemed that someone was calling her name. When he quietly called her she couldn\\'t get out from under the bed. She wanted to get out and was calling softly. She thought she was shouting, but in fact she was either silent or was only talking to herself, it just seemed to her that she was shouting. When she got out from under the bed everyone was gone. And again . . . She thought that she had losther mind. I\\'ll never leave here, never! To hell with it! It just seems that way to me, I\\'ll come to eventually. But then, when everything had settled down, stopped, that mall brought Lyuda down, and Igor carried me in fromoutside. Or first I was brought in, then Lyuda, I don\\'t remember what order ithappened in.And Mamma said, \"Listen, they\\'re all running around down there, shouting something or other, and running toward the other building.\" It had more or less calmed down where we were. Who\\'s dead, who\\'s alive, we don\\'t know. I tried to call my girlfriend. I had basically come to. Mamma says, \"Listen;let\\'s go upstairs, at least get a mattress or something. We don\\'t know how long we\\'ll be here. Maybe they didn\\'t burn everything.\" I don\\'t get it, allwomen have that feeling, they want to get something from their homes, maybe not everything was taken? I tell Mamma, \"Mamma, what do you need any of that for? To hell with it! We\\'re alive, forget the rest of it, all of it!\" Shesays, \"No, let\\'s go get at least something. Maybe we\\'ll leave here, spend the night at someone else\\'s.\" Mamma went upstairs, and their little boy, their sonAlik, was standing on the lookout. lIe was standing there to see if they were coming. They only managed to run up there and grab something one time. He shouts, \"Come back, they\\'re coming!\" They didn\\'t have enough time to get a lot, mattresses from one apartment, a blanket from another . . . Mamma got my knitting . . . Someone managed to grab our old things, the ones we never wore,out of the hall . . . Someone took Father\\'s old coveralls. The neighbor, his wife, Mamma and Papa . . . Marina went with them. I was in no condition to leave. Neither was Lyuda. We just sat. They ran out and we closed the door andjust then we hear that the mob is on its way toward our place upstairs, they\\'re dragging something again. They were going toward the other building, maybe over by the school, or . . . There was an unfinished building overthere, people said they were going toward the basement or the unfinished building, they could gradually carry everything over there. Then things more or less calmed down. I tried to call my boss.Later there was more noise. We were on the third floor, in a one-bedroomapartment, and a woman lives in the one-bedroom place on the second floor,Asya Dallakian. She\\'s an old woman, retired. She wasn\\'t at home, at thattime she was usually in the country, she has a married daughter there, andher grandson is in the army. She is only very rarely in town; she gets herretirement money and the apartment is essentially vacant. They startedpounding on her door and broke it down. She had two or three beds in there, something like that, she\\'s a 60-to 70-year-old woman who really does not even live there. Probably she had some pots, a couple of metal bed frames and mattresses, and a television. When her grandson came she bought a television. They started wrecking everything. I started getting sick again. I think, \"My God, what is going on around here? When will this end?\" We turned off the lights and sat. As it turns out the people who weren\\'t afraid, the ones who knew what was going on, knew not to turn off the lights. We didn\\'t know, but they didn\\'t come to where we were all the same. They all knew very well that he was a captain. He went out and closed the door, and we sat in his apartment. His last name was Kasumov. He\\'s an exserviceman, retired, works up at the fire station at some plant or other. He went out and stood at his door.They tell him, \"Comrade Captain, don\\'t worry, we won\\'t harm you, you\\'re one ofus.\" He went upstairs, and they say, \"Aren\\'t you taking anything from this apartment?\" He says, \"I don\\'t need anything.\" And the women who were standing in the yard . . . we have a basement, full of water . . . the women who were standing in the yard saw. Those guys, they left everything they stole on the first floor and ran upstairs again. The women threw everything they had time to into the basement, to save our property. Some things were left: dirty pillows, two or three other things and a rug. A guy came downstairs, really mad, and he says, \"Where\\'s the rug? I just put it right here!\" They tell him, \"Some guy came and took it and went off toward the school.\" He ran off in thatdirection.Oh! I forgot the most important point. When Igor picked me up in his arms, there were women standing there who saw everything that was going on. They just didn\\'t tell me about it for a long time. The wife of that military man, she didn\\'t want to kill my spirit, I was already dead enough. Later she told me, that after they murdered Uncle Shurik in the third entryway one of them, the ringleader, apparently a young man, said, \"Where\\'s the girl who was here?\"And he became furious. The woman tells him, \"She came to . . . \" She didn\\'tknow what to say: Think something up? Someone carried her off? Then they wouldcomb the whole house and find me and our whole family. So the woman says, \"Shecame to and went to the basement.\" Now, our basement is full of water. So the whole mob dashes off to the basement to look for me or my corpse. They took flashlights; they were up to their waists in water, water which had been standing there for years, and soot, and fuel oil. They climbed down in there to get me. Then one of them said, \"There\\'s so much water down there, she probably walked and walked and then passed out and died. She met her death in the basement. That\\'s it, we can leave, no problem!\" I didn\\'t know that, and when I was told, I felt worse. Two times worse. A lot worse! So they didn\\'t just want to pound me flat, something more awful was awaiting me . . .After that we of course didn\\'t want to live in Sumgait any longer. We really didn\\'t want to go back to our apartment. When we moved, I went up there and started to quiver and shake all over, because I started remembering it all. Although the neighbors all sobbed, it was all . . . so cheap . . . The people who sat in their apartments and didn\\'t help us at a time like that. I think that they could have helped! I don\\'t think that they were obligated to, but they could have helped us! Because that one woman was able to stop that whole brutal crowd by herself. That means they could have, too. It would have beenenough foe one man or women to say, What do you think you\\'re doing?\" That\\'s all! That would have done it. There were 60 apartments in our building. Not one person said it! When I was lying on the ground and all those people were standing on their balconies I didn\\'t hear anyone\\'s voice, no one said what areyou doing, leave her alone . . . Mamma even told one of the neighbor women that if it had been an Azerbaijani woman in my place they would have dropped abomb if it would have killed even one Armenian. They would have stood up for one of their own. True, they say that our neighbor from the fourth entryway, an old/ sick woman tried to stop the pogrom. The Azerbaijanis have a custom: if a woman takes her scarf and throws it on the ground, the men are supposed to stop immediately. The old woman from the fourth entryway did that, but theystomped her scarf into the ground, pushed her off to the side, and said, \"Ifyou want to go on living, you\\'ll disappear into your apartment.\" So she left.That trick didn\\'t work on them.Even the neighbors who helped us move told me, OK, fine, calm down, forget that it happened. I said I\\'d only forget it if I told them right then that ithad happened to their daughter--and if that didn\\'t have any effect on them, then I would forget everything, too. Imagine that it happened to your sister. And no one did anything. Anything.

My criteria: a \"fun\" car with ABS, airbag, over 130hp, and less than $25K.I thought about a turbo, but checking with insurance people ruled that out.The Tri-Star cars (Eclipse/Talon/etc) were out since they don\\'t have an air bag.Ditto for the Mustang(also no ABS).The SE-R/NX2000/M20 fell into the pocket-rocket category.  A good used car buy.The MX-6 was almost there but rolled more than I liked.  I didn\\'t like the Prelude dash/instrumentation at all.  Too weird for me.The MR2 has a much smaller non-passenger space than I needed, so out that went.The Celica was \"ok\" but underpowered when loaded with options (and somewhatoverpriced too) in non-turbo form.I never considered the 240SX since it didn\\'t have an airbag.  I did look at itfor its RWD virtues but that\\'s it.  The Corolla never entered my mind.I should have looked at the Mitsubishi VR4/Dodge Stealth more.Since my list was exhausted, I bought the Probe.  :-)The car design is different than earlier years, so it\\'s too early to see itsreliability so far.  For what it\\'s worth, my comments:My dislikes:Shutting door with windows up from inside rarely makes good wind seal.Headlights have \"stuck\" up a few times (weather?)air conditioning broke ~4000 miles (pressure cycling switch)condensation around rear washer fluid container doesn\\'t drain completely.crammed engine; little hope for do-it-yourselfers (typical)parts somewhat more expensive than normal Ford partsunderside plastic doesn\\'t like sharp driveways and speedbumps (typical).assembly gripes: tape on radiator, screw fell out of dash, seat seams not stitched properly.  Hopefully just a fluke.Ford only gives 1 key with the car.  C\\'mon Ford, spend an extra few pennies!Rear hatch has no padding on corners when up.  I\\'m waiting for the day whenI bash my head on the corner.horn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center (personal preference)Tires fling dirt/mud onto side of car My Likes:engine (design/valves/sounds/smoothness/power/mileage/torque) -- definitely #1handling (very good for FWD; understeer only at limits)transmission (the 5 speed is a must)usable instrumentation (lovely readable analog everywhere)Very little torque steer at full power (much better than the \\'90 SHO I drive)stability at 100+mph (high gearing though)low cowl (good visibility in front)Heated outside mirrors (nice in fog, never tested in freezing weather)ABS/Air bag (see above)rear seats fold down (I have few rear seat passengers so a trunk not important)No shake/rattle noises when going over bumps/potholes (still!)Tires: 225/55VR16 Goodyear Eagles (70% left; hoping for 30K :-)As you can see, I\\'m primarily interested in the engine.  While it doesn\\'thave the uummmph of a big-liter car or the turbo rush, the big sellingpoint for me was the all-aluminum 24 value 2.5 liter engine.  The overall car is a good buy for the money.  That market segment hasn\\'t changedmuch since July (Prelude VTEC, Honda Del Sol??).  I drive it to and from workeach day on relatively smooth roads, and most noticable thing is that theProbe\\'s suspension doesn\\'t like potholes.  When you test drive one, find a potholed road somewhere around town and see if the jarring you get is tolerable.If you have 3+ passengers, by all means bring them along too.  They\\'ll findthat they have no room in the back and you\\'ll find that the car ridesdifferently (if that\\'s \"better\" is up to you).  Also, there\\'s a lot of glassaround you which I wasn\\'t expecting; the temperature inside the car gets prettyhot in the summer.  My back seat passengers (now very few) complain aboutthe lack of ventilation; you may want to consider that when combined withthe heat.  I\\'ve heard that the exhaust system has trouble, but mine works fine.Leather and the keyless entry system weren\\'t available when I got the car soI can\\'t comment on them (I got the car before it was officially announced).  I prefer cloth to leather anyway.  I wouldn\\'t want this car in the snow:  The suspension is too rough for theinevitable surprise potholes, tires aren\\'t meant for snow, and the seats assumethat you\\'re not wearing lots of thick clothing.  Rain is much better:  water generally beads off the windshield at freeway speed, the windshield wipercontrols are easy and understandable, and I barely hydroplaned once with theEagles (and I was really trying).  There is also a definite lack of cup holder/small storage places.  The GThas map holders below the speakers in the door, but they\\'re rigid plasticthat could fit two cassettes or CD\\'s max.  The center console/storage bin/armrest has *1* cup holder and the back of the front seats have a cloth \"pouch\"but that\\'s it.  No change holders.  Quite a let-down from the SHO.And the Probe is definitely not a people-mover car or an econo-box car!Lastly, don\\'t store wet car covers in the back.  The foam will soak the water up and the result will *not* smell pleasant :-(.Nathannathan@sco.com>>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>|Jeremy Mereness                 | Support     | Ye Olde Disclaimer:    |>|zonker+@cmu.edu (internet)      |    Free     |  The above represent my|>| FAST Project, CMU-GSIA         |     Software|   opinions, alone.     |>|B.S.

While the United States and 48 of the fifty states call their   highest court \"Supreme Court,\" \"Supreme Judicial Court\" or \"Supreme   Court of Appeals,\" Maryland and New York call theirs simply the   \"Court of Appeals.\"  To make matters worse, New York also calls its   _second-highest_ court the \"Supreme Court, Appellate Division\"...Atlantic Cement Co._, 26 N.Y.2d 219, 257 N.E.2d 870 (1970)):Oscar H. Boomer, et al., owned land near the Atlantic Cement company\\'splant near Albany, N.Y.  (The fact pattern gives no information as towhich came first, the plaintiff\\'s acquisition of the land or hedefendant\\'s start of production at their cement plant.)  In the courseof its regular operations, the cement plant did injury to theplaintiffs\\' property via dirt, smoke and vibrations emanating from theplant.  The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief -- that is, they askedthe court to order Atlantic Cement to stop damaging their property.(Commentary: this seems entirely reasonable to me.  Boomer at al ownedtheir property and, presumably, a right to quiet enjoyment of it.Atlantic Cement\\'s actions were depriving Boomer et al of that right.)Instead of granting the plaintiffs\\' request for an injunction, the courtordered them to accept the damage being done to their property, providedthat Atlantic Cement paid them $185,000 in compensatory damages.  Inother words, the court granted Atlantic Cement Co., a private party, thepower and authority to _take_ the plaintiffs rights to quiet enjoymentof their property by eminent domain.  A taking by eminent domain isalways problematical even when it\\'s done by the state; allowing aprivate firm to do it is, in my opinion, totally wrong.(Yes, I know, the _Boomer_ court didn\\'t call it eminent domain.  But ifit walks like eminent domain and swims like eminent domain and quackslike eminent domain...)Let me take issue with the way you\\'ve presented the case... you say that\"What happened in _Boomer_ was that the judge didn\\'t allow theplaintiffs to blackmail the cement plant by demanding a multi-milliondollar plant to be shut down over $185,000 in damages.\"  Blackmail?    (Pulls out Black\\'s Law Dictionary, Abridged 5th Edition....    \"Blackmail: Unlawful demand of money or property under threat to    do bodily harm, to injure property, to accuse of crime, or to expose    disgraceful defects.  This crime is commonly included under    extortion statutes.\")How do you define as \"blackmail\" one party\\'s act of demanding the rightto set its own sale price for a unique piece of property which it ownsand which another party has expressed an interest in buying?  Or ofdemanding the right not to sell that property at any price?  As I seeit, Boomer et al, having found themselves in the fortunate position ofowning something which Atlantic Cement had to purchase if it wanted tostay in business, had every right in the world to set whatever pricethey wanted.  There isn\\'t, or at least shouldn\\'t be, any law that saysthat you have to be a nice guy in your private business dealings.You go on to say: \"The plant would never have been shut down -- theplaintiff\\'s lawyers would have just negotiated a windfall settlement,because the plaintiffs would prefer an amount greater than $185K tohaving the plant shut down, while the plant would prefer any amount lessthan the value of the plant to have the plant continue in operation.\"If so, so what?  Since when are the courts supposed to be in thebusiness of preventing parties from reaping windfall settlements fromother parties when those settlements arise from wrongful acts by thoseother parties?  If Atlantic Cement didn\\'t want to have to face a choicebetween paying a windfall settlement or going out of business, well,shouldn\\'t Atlantic Cement have thought of that before going _into_business?  (I note that as far as the facts show Boomer et al were _not_the parties responsible for bringing about this situation -- that wasAtlantic Cement\\'s own fault for choosing to build and operate the typeof plant they did where and when they did.)And then you say: \"Everyone\\'s property rights were protected; theplaintiffs were made whole; unnecessary settlement costs were avoided.\"As above, I dispute your claim that the plaintiffs were \"made whole.\"They were, in fact, by court action deprived of their rights as ownersof property to choose to sell or not sell that property at a priceacceptable to them.  And for that deprivation they were _not_ madewhole.  And again I ask: Since when are the courts supposed to be in thebusiness of ensuring that \"unnecessary\" settlement costs are avoided?(If so, I\\'ve been miseducated -- I always thought that the courts weresupposed to be in the business of ensuring that justice is done.)> Is _Boomer_ really being taught as \"infamous?\"  That\\'s really sad if> it is, because I fail to see how it\\'s less than completely sensible.> You should read the law and economics stuff first-hand instead of> filtered through teachers who clearly don\\'t like it, for whatever> inexplicable reasons.(1) _Boomer_ is not being taught as \"infamous,\" at least not at myschool.(Aside: Northeastern Law usually does a very good job of hiring fortheir first-year, mandatory classes (such as Torts, where I firstencountered _Boomer_) instructors who, regardless of their personalopinions, can and do teach the law neutrally.  When the students getinto their second and third years, in which the students (a) can pickand choose which courses to take (except for the mandatory ProfessionalResponsibility, of course) and (b) are presumed to be a bit more worldlyand self-confident, less likely to be consciously or sub-consciouslyintimidated by Law School Professors and able to learn from openlybiased instructors rather than be indoctrinated by them, the instructorstend to be more open in expressing their own opinions.  This isespecially true of part-time instructors who, in real life, arepracticing attorneys or sitting judges... this can be _very_educational, sometimes far more so than being taught by a somewhatcloistered scholar.  End of aside.)I called it infamous because that\\'s my opinion of it.  For the reasonsI\\'ve stated above, I believe it to be a triumph of something that I canonly call \"economic correctness\" over justice.(2) It is \"completely sensible\" only if you believe that the allegedright of the owners of Atlantic Cement to stay in business and avoidlosing a lot of their own money due to their own wrongful act, andthe alleged right of several hundred Atlantic Cement employees tonot have their jobs disappear, should trump the rights of people whoown property which was damaged by Atlantic Cement\\'s wrongful acts.(And if you believe that it is correct for the courts (or any otherbranch of government) to grant to private parties the right to takeother people\\'s property by eminent domain.)> You\\'d like Posner, Bill.

(I\\'ve seen Mike Godwin claim> that Posner asserts that law and economics is applicable to everything> and is the end-all and be-all, when Posner says precisely the> opposite.)  So it goes.I\\'ve admitted that my understanding of the field generally referred toas \"law and economics\" is weak.  If it advocates the use of economicalanalysis as one of many \"tie-breaker\" factors which courts may use tohelp them reach decisions in cases in which the dispute, as measured bythe scale of \"justice\", is evenly balanced, fine.  But as illustrated by_Boomer_, it is _not_ fine when the courts start viewing the economicsof a case as being more important than the justice of a case.-- William December Starr <wdstarr@athena.mit.edu>',\n",

That makes sense from their point of view, BUT when this cover is used, the guerillas should accept some of the responsibility for subsequent harm to civilians.> If the buffer zone is to prevent attacks on Israel, is it not working?

I have always thought that Israel\\'s bombingsortees and bombing policy is stupid, thoughtless, inhumane ANDineffective. BUT, there is no reason that Israel should passive wait until attackers chose to act; there is every reason to believe that\"taking the fight *to* the enemy\" will do more to stop attacks. As I said previously, Israel spent several decades \"sitting passively\"on its side of a border and only acting to stop these attacks *after*the attackers had entered Israeli territory. It didn\\'t work very well.The \"host\" Arab state did little/nothing to try and stop these attacks from its side of the border with Israel so the number of attackswere considerably higher, as was their physical and psychological impact on the civilians caught in their path.  >>|> What?So the whole bit about attacks on Israel from neighboring Arab states >|> can start all over again?

This is just another \"selectively applied\" statement. The reason for this drawn-out impasse between Ababs/Palestinians and Israelisis that NEITHER side is willing to accept the Word of the other. By yourcriteria *everyone* should stay away from the negotiations.That is precisely why the Palestinians (in their recent PISGA proposal for the \"interim\" period after negotiations and leading up to full autonomy) aredemanding conditions that essentially define \"autonomy\" already. They DONOT trust that Israel will \"follow through\" the entire process and allowPalestinians to reach full autonomy. Do you understand and accept this viewpoint by the Palestinians? If you do, then why should Israel\\'s view of Arabs/Palestinians be any different? Why should they trust the Arab/Palestinians\\' words?Since they don\\'t, they are VERY reluctant to give up \"tangible assets (land, control of areas) in exchange for \"words\". For this reason,they are also concerned about the sorts of \"guarantees\" they will have that the Arabs WILL follow through on their part of any agreement reached.>>But don\\'t you see that the same statement can be made both ways?>If Lebanon was interested in peace then it should accept the word>of Israel that the attacks were the cause for war and disarming the>Hizbollah will remove the cause for its continued occupancy.  Absolutely, so are the Arabs/Palestinians asking FIRST for theIsraelis \"word\" in relation to any agreement? NO, what is beingdemanded FIRST is LAND. When the issue is LAND, and one partyfinally gets HOLD of this \"land\", what the \"other party\" doesis totally irrelevent. If I NOW have possession of this land,your words have absolutely no power; whether Israel chooses tokeeps its word does NOT get the land back.>Afterall, Israel has already staged two parts of the withdrawal from >areas it occupied in Lebanon during SLG.>> Tim, you are ignoring the fact that the Palestinians in Lebanon have been> disarmed. Hezbollah remains the only independent militia. Hezbollah does> not attack Israel except at a few times such as when the IDF burned up> Sheikh Mosavi, his wife, and young son. While the \"major armaments\" (those allowing people to wage \"civil wars\")have been removed, the weapons needed to cross-border attacks stillremain to some extent. Rocket attacks still continue, and \"commando\"raids only require a few easily concealed weapons and a refined disregardfor human life (yours of that of others). Such attacks also continue.> Of course, if Israel would withdraw from Lebanon> and stop assassinating people and shelling villages they wouldn\\'t> make the Lebanese so mad as to do that.Bat guano. The situation you call for existed in the 1970s and attackswere commonplace.>Furthermore, with Hezbollah subsequently disarmed, it would not be possible.There is NO WAY these groups can be effectively \"disarmed\" UNLESS the stateis as authoritarian is Syria\\'s. The only other way is for Lebanon to takeit upon itself to constantly patrol the entire border with Israel, essentiallymirroring Israel\\'s border secirity on its side. It HAS TO PROVE TO ISREAL thatit is this committed to protecting Israel from attack from Lebanese territory.>>|> Once Syria leaves who is to say that Lebanon will be able to retain >|> control?

But, doesn\\'t that mean that Syria has to \"take over\"Lebanon? I don\\'t think Israel or Lebanon would like that.> What both \"sides\" need is to receive something \"tangible\". The Arabs/Palestinians are looking for \"land\" and demanding that they receive itprior to giving anything to Israel. Israel has two problems: 1) if itgives up real *land* it IS exposing itself to a changed geostrategicsituation (and that change doesn\\'t help Israel\\'s position), and 2) WHENit gives up this land IT NEEDS to receive something in return tocompensate for the increased risksTim',\n",

On-ice, the Leafs won the Atlantic Division title butoff ice was less happy. A strike by public workers has forced theleafs out of the Newfoundland city for much of the last half ofthe seaosn (since mid-Jan). They have played \"home\" games in placeslike Montreal, Cornwall and Charlottetown. Their playoff \"home\"games will be played in the Metro Center in Halifax, NS. Onedemostration got violent. Workers attacked a Leafs\\' bus androcked it and broke windows in the St John\\'s Memorial Stadium.Despite the problems, Toronto officials insist that the Leafswill return to St John\\'s once the strike ends.===================================================SENATORS SOLDThe New Haven Senators have been sold by Peter Shipman tothe Ottawa Senators NHL organization. They are the only CanadianNHL team with an American AHL affiliate, and have made it clearthey intend to move the team to somewhere in the Canadian AtlanticProvinces. This sale and move has yet to be approved by the AHLhead office, but is expected to pass easily at the general meetingin May. The quote in the story from Jack Butterfield made it clear the league was more interested in the stability of the AHL franchise accompanied by NHL ownership, rather than maintainingthe 56-year history of the AHL in New Haven. The Senators are currently in serious negotiations with CharlottetownNew Brunswick and are expected to move there.==================================================DALLAS HELPS HAWKS STAY IN MONCTONAfter announcing that they would pull their affiliation outof Moncton, the Winnipeg Jets changed their mind. The Jets announced the move when they said that they would be slashingtheir minor league roster from 20-something to around a dozen; and theywanted to share with an existing AHL or IHL franchise.Enter the Dallas Lone Stars. Dallas agreed to supply the remaining6 or 8 players to the Moncton franchise. Thus keeping the Hawksin the New Brunswick city.The deal is for one year and will be extended to three years ifthe season ticket base increases to over 3000. The Hawks only sold1400 for this year.============================================================SAINT JOHN FLAMES OFFICIALThe Calgary Flames have officially signed a deal with the city ofSaint John, NB. The Saint John Blue Flames will play in the 6200Exhibition Center. The Flames still have to apply for an expansionfrnachise from the AHL but are expected to have no trouble.=========================================================CAPS FOLLOW JACKS TO MAINEDespite rumors to the contrary, the Capitals will follow the BaltimoreSkipjacks to Maine. The Caps\\' current farm team, the Baltimore Skipjacks,announced that they would move to Maine and become the Portland Pirates.There was much doubt as to if the Caps would follow but they announceda limited deal with Portland. They would supply a dozen or so playersincluding 2 goalies. They become the third team to announce a limitedfarm team along with Moncton and the Capital District Islanders.======================================================AHL GAME OF THE WEEKIn early January, the AHL started a game of the week. The game, producedby, I believe, Pyman Productions, was televised across the CanadianMaritimes and northeastern US. The first few weeks saw two games ofthe week, one in Canada and another in the US but since then, therehas been only one. Sunday afternoon and night games were covered andshown on Sportschannel NY and NE in the US and, I believe, AtlanticSports Network in Canada (but I\\'m not sure about that). I am notsure if playoff games will be covered.=====================================================UTICA GONE? SYRACUSE ADDED?There were heavy rumors that the Utica Devils will not be around nextseason. There were rumors that they might be headed to a midwesterncity and that the city of Syracuse is trying to lure them.=====================================================WHAT THE AHL MIGHT LOOK LIKE NEXT YEARONE OPTIONANOTHER OPTIONNorthern DivisionSouthern DivisionADIRONDACK RED WINGSADIRONDACKSPRINGFIELD INDIANSSPRINGFIELDPROVIDENCE BRUINSPROVIDENCECD ISLANDERSCDIPORTLAND PIRATESHERSHEYBINGHAMTONSouthern DivisionROCHESTERHERSHEY BEARSHAMILTONBINGHAMTON RANGERSUTICAROCHESTER AMERICANSHAMILTON CANUCKSAtlantic DivisionUTICA (?)

The BATF's jurisdiction is TAXES on firearmsand tobacco.  They are a branch of the department of the treasury.  They havevery curiously backed away from their claims of illegal weaponry to push thechild-abuse charges... The BATF has no jurisdiction over non-firearms/tobaccoissues! And the charges of child-abuse had been investigated in the past withno violence and no validation.  This was a clear case of first the BATF, thenthe FBI, having watched too many Rambo movies...  My opinion is that the agentin charge should be charged with executing an illegal raid, criminal negligence,murder, civil rights violations, and breaking his/her oath to uphold and defendthe Constitution of the US.  The warrant should be unsealed to reveal to the public what justification the BATF thought it had in committing an armed assaulton American citizens.  And while on the issue of investigating this issue,the Randy Weaver case and the Johnny Lawmaster case should be investigated forBATF wrongdoing.Jamesbtw, if the BATF came busting in my windows with concussion grenades, you could damn well bet I would return fire to the utmost of my ability.-- ********************************************************************************James S.

Just briefly, on something that you mentioned in passing. You refer to     differing interpretations of \"create,\" and say that many Christians may     not agree. So what? That is really irrelevant. We do not base our faith     on how many people think one way or another, do we? The bottom line is     truth, regardless of popularity of opinions.

The Mormon belief is that all are children of God. Literally. There is     nothing symbolic about it. This however, contradicts what the Bible     says. The Bible teaches that not everyone is a child of God:          The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the           kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked [one];          (Matthew 13:38)          I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which           ye have seen with your father. (John 8:38)          Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not           born of fornication; we have one Father, [even] God.  Jesus said           unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I           proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he           sent me.  Why do ye not understand my speech? [even] because ye           cannot hear my word.  Ye are of [your] father the devil, and the           lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the           beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in           him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a           liar, and the father of it. (John 8:41-44)          And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, [thou] child of           the devil, [thou] enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease           to pervert the right ways of the Lord? (Acts 13:10)          Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this           world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit           that now worketh in the children of disobedience: (Ephesians 2:2)          In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the           devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he           that loveth not his brother. (1 John 3:10)     One becomes a child of God...          But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the          sons of God, [even] to them that believe on his name: (John 1:12)          Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that          we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us          not, because it knew him not.  Beloved, now are we the sons of God,          and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when          he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he          is. (1 John 3:1-2)     ...when he is born again through faith in Jesus Christ:          Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of          the will of man, but of God. (John 1:13)          Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus          Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,          (Ephesians 1:5)          Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should          be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures. (James 1:18)          For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of          God. For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear;          but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba,          Father. The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we          are the children of God: (Romans 8:14-16)          Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one          that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. (1 John 4:7)          Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and          every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is          begotten of him.

Whose \"Jesus of the Bible\" do you mean?     This is really a red herring. It doesn\\'t address any issue raised, but      rather, it seeks to obfuscate. The fact that some groups try to read      something into the Bible, doesn\\'t change what the Bible teaches. For      example, the fact that the Jehovah\\'s Witnesses deny the Deity of Christ      does not alter what the Bible teaches [ \"Looking for that blessed hope,     and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus     Christ;\" (Titus 2:13),\"Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus     Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through     the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:\" (2 Peter 1:1)]      on the Deity of Christ.     We first look to the Bible to see what it teaches. To discount, or not      even address, what the Bible teaches because there are some groups that      have differing views is self-defeating. To see what the Bible teaches,      you have to look at the Bible.ra> >     \"Our Lord\\'s mortality was essential to his own salvation\" (_Thera> >     Promised Messiah_, p. 456), \"He had to work out his own salvation byra> >     doing the will of the Father in all things\" (ibid., p.54), \"he hadra> >     to be baptized to gain admission to the celestial kingdom\" (_Mormonra> >     Doctrine_, p.71).ra>ra>    Welcome to the wonderful world of Mormon paradoctrine, Robert.

The curious part is that no one addressed the     issue of `Jesus needing to be saved.\\' Rick comes the closest with his \"I     have my own conclusions\" to addressing the point.     Most of the other replies have instead hop-scotched to the issue of     Bruce McConkie and whether his views were \\'official doctrine.\\' I don\\'t     think that it matters if McConkie\\'s views were canon. That is not the     issue.  Were McConkie\\'s writings indicative of Mormon belief on this     subject is the real issue.

As usual, Sahl\\'s was independent and sharp as a scalpel.My effort can only dream of comparing favorably to Mort\\'s. At least it has a fairly popular orginating premise; everyone I\\'d mention the idea to thought it was either divinely inspired or at least past due for delivery.Those reactions are based on parallels that should be obvious to the most peripheral observer of the Acts of those False Prophets. Both are noted for their galvanizing oratorical skills, which they both used with passion to generate a political cult of massive numerical proportions (in fact, Limbaugh claims to have an audience of just over 12 million, almost identical to the number of votes cast for Hitler in the April 1932 German election). Both used a myopic social perspective to build the cult, and enthusiastically amputated facts from the record to fabricate their ideological quilt.The last point is glaringly documented by passages in the opening pages of both books. Hitler\\'s example is when, on page 5, he claims the German nationalist terrorist Leo Schlageter (he bombed part of a railway line between Dusseldorf and Duisburg, being caught in the act, in 1923) was \"betrayed to France by a representative of his government\" when there has never been any factual foundation for such a statement.In fact, the governments of both the Reich and Prussia, as well as the Vatican, actively intervened to save him from execution, and almost succeeded. Limbaugh follows suit by making the hysterically sarcastic claim in his introduction that \"in a school or during a commencement ceremony or many other public places... God is unconstitutional.\" Of course, it\\'s not God but the official imposition of particular concepts of God against an individual\\'s will that\\'s unconstitutional. But Limbaugh is too gleeful in his talent for distortion to want you to know that.Of course, one would assume that, by comparing the two books, my main point would be that The Way Things Ought to Be is the modern American Mein Kampf. Not really. At the time of the first German version of Mein Kampf, Hitler was just four months out of prison (June, 1925), and trying to reorganize the Nazis. He used the book to build his dozen million followers. Limbaugh, on the other hand, came up with his book after building his dozen million. Twelve million went a longer way in Weimar Germany that it does in the Republicrat United States.Thus, the more accurate parallels would be that Limbaugh\\'s daily three-hour radio show is the American Mein Kampf, the primary propoganda tool used to pump up the angry volume; and that The Way Things Ought to Be is actually the American Triumph of the Will, a translation of the same fascist message into a different medium. Also, the printed word was the more important medium in Weimar Germany, since radio was still being thought of by impoverished Germans as a medium of luxury in 1925. Today, on the other hand, Americans are more likely to spend a few seconds to tune a radio dial at no monetary charge than drop $22 for 304 pages of transcripts of the same words.But, as Mort Sahl also observed on the radio the other night, some cloutmeister of the radical right wants Limbaugh to be a focal point of their propoganda. (And remember, Sahl is an Al Haig conservative these days.)Mort might not know exactly who Rush\\'s equivalent of Rodolf Hess is (the book itself suggests Ed McLaughlin, the former president of ABC radio and now Limbaugh\\'s partner in EFM Media, the radio program\\'s production company). But Mort himself is a veteran of the talk show, having hosted them in New York, Washington and Los Angeles. He knows what evil lurks in the hearts of major market media men. He knows that Limbaugh could not have collected his audience had not the opportunity been placed on a silver platter and handed to him. Limbaugh earns his money just as honestly as Al Capone did; it\\'s almost worthy of a RICO indictment.On questions of social issues, there is an overabundance of material in the Limbaugh book that seems to echo Hitler\\'s venom. For example:On Their Own Qualifications to Control SocietyHitler: \"Out of the host of sometimes millions of people, who individually more or less clearly and distinctly guess the truth, partly perhaps understand it, one man [author\\'s emphasis] must step forward in order to form, with apodeictic force, out of the wavering world of imagination of the great masses, granite principles, and to take up the fight for their sole correctness, until out of the playing waves of a free world of thought a brazen rock of uniform combination of form and will arises\" (page 577).Limbaugh: \"Who needs the media when they\\'ve got me? ... The show is devoted exclusively to what I think ... [the phrase \"with half my brain tied behind my back to make it even\"] denotes the egress of mental aptitude I require to engage and demolish liberals and others who disagree with me ... It might take four or five years, but I\\'m convinced The Media will slowly and reluctantly come around to my way of thinking, kicking and screaming all the way.\" (pages 266, 21, 299 and 273, respectively.)On Religion as the Basis of a NationHitler: \"In this world human culture and civilization are inseperably bound up with the existence of the Aryan. His dying-off or his decline would again lower upon this earth the dark veils of a time without culture ... He who dares to lay hand upon the highest image of the Lord sins against the benevolent Creator of this miracle and helps in the expulsion from Paradise.\" (Page 581.)Limbaugh: \"America was founded as a Judeo-Christian country ... But our intellectual and political elites are often either hostile or ambivalent toward religion ... People for whom belief in God is at best a charming superstition have managed to ban prayer from the public schools for the last thirty years. Is it only a coincidence that the quality of American education has declined ever since?\" (pages 274-5.)On Popular Culture as a Reason for Social CollapseHitler: \"The fight against the poisoning of the soul has to set in ... One has only to look at the menus of our movie houses, vaudevilles and theatres; and one can hardly deny that this is not the right kind of food ... Theatre, art, literature, movies, the press, billposters and window displays must be cleaned of the symptoms of a rotting world and put into the service of a moral idea of State and culture.\" (pages 346 and 348.)Limbaugh: \"Today, Hollywood is in trouble. The reason [is] that Hollywood has forgotten who its audience is ... They make fun of people who believe in God. They ridicule the traditional family, heterosexuality and monagamy. They disparage American heroes.\" (page 254.)On the News MeidaHitler: \"The activity of the so-called liberal press was the work of gravediggers for the German people and the German Reich. One can pass by in silence the Marxist papers of lies ... it\\'s task is only to break the people\\'s folkish and national spine, in order to make it ripe for the yoke of slavery of international capital and its masters, the Jews.\" (Page 331.)Limbaugh: \"Elements of The Media have jumped on the bandwagon of leftist causes. The cynical journalist of the past has been replaced in many cases by an enthusiastic cheerleader for causes ... During the Gulf war, CNN correspondent Bernard Shaw [said] CNN is a global network. We can\\'t take sides. Cant take sides? --- --- ---! ... If they don\\'t realize that their freedom lies in the United States of America and that therefore they should defend this nation, they are hopelessly misguided and, may I suggest, flirting with megalomania.\" (pages 270 and 268.)*     *     *To continue these comparative excerpts is certainly possible, but ultimately too depressing to take in one reading.After putting these books down, there is one undeniable fact that haunts me. In the 1920s, Adolf Hitler fed depressed and frightened Germans the opiate of hatred of those around them; in turn, it allowed Germans to hand their collective national power to the Nazis. In the 1990s, Rush Limbaugh is doing the very same thing: distributing hatred to depressed and frightened Americans; in turn, it is helping the American radical right to maintain its power base as the 12-year nightmare of the Reagan-Bush era comes to an end, hoping to rebuild it into their hopes for The Fascist States of America.And if Limbaugh is not as repellant a Hitler, it is only because the radical right utilizes Limbaugh as its own gateway opiate. One can only wonder what the ultimate drug is they plan to hook America on.The Madison Edge can be reached at PO Box 845, Madison, WI 53701-0845; (608) 255-4460.--- 30 ---',\n",

BACKGROUND ---------- The racing listserver (boogie.EBay.sun.com) contains discussions  devoted to racing and racing-related topics. This is a pretty broad  interest group. Individuals have a variety of backgrounds: motojournalism,  roadracing from the perspective of pit crew and racers, engineering, motosports enthusiasts. The size of the list grows weekly. We are currently at a little over one hundred and eighty-five members, with contributors from New Zealand, Australia, Germany, France, England, Canada Finland, Switzerland, and the United States. The list was formed (October 1991) in response to a perceived need  to both provide technical discussion of riding at the edge of  performance (roadracing) and to improve on the very low signal-to-noise  ratio found in rec.motorcycles. Anyone is free to join. Discussion is necessarily limited by the rules of the list to  issues related to racing motorcycles and is to be \"flame-free\".   HOW TO GET THE DAILY DISTRIBUTION --------------------------------- You are welcome to subscribe. To subscribe send your request to:        race-request@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM Traffic currently runs between five and twenty-five messages per day (depending on the topic).    NB: Please do _not_ send your subscription request to the       list directly.  After you have contacted the list administrator, you will receive an RSVP request. Please respond to this request in a timely manner so that you can be added to the list. The request is generated in order to insure that there is a valid mail pathway to your site.  Upon receipt of your RSVP, you will be added to either the daily or digest distribution (as per your initial request). HOW TO GET THE DIGEST DISTRIBUTION ---------------------------------- It is possible to receive the list in \\'digest\\'ed form (ie. a single email message). The RoadRacing Digest is mailed out  whenever it contains enough interesting content. Given the frequency of postings this appears to be about every other day.

I don\\'t care if there are going toreform their dealers/service with the intro of the LH cars, I will believeit when I see it.  Case and point, the local dodge dealer.

I had an alignment problem, butthey tried to tell me that the K frame was bent, and about 2000 dollars ofwork/parts to fix it.

In the end, before Itraded it in for a Saturn, the power steering started acting up again.  Ijust stopped putting money into it.  I must have put at least $5000-$7000worth of repairs over it\\'s lifetime.  I am sorry but Lee Iacocca can biteme.  Bullshit, whoever backs em best, is just afraid the stupid things aregoing to fall apart, and no one will buy them without assurance, why thehell do you think that LH has been nicknamed Last Hope.You can do better, and I know people will disagree with me here, butJapanese, like Honda, or Toyota, or the only american car company that Ifeel is a quality product, Saturn.  I will not touch another chryslerproduct again, no way.  I don\\'t care how good the LH cars look good, and Iwill admit they look promising, but not with the support that you get.  GMisn\\'t much better, thank god, they don\\'t control Saturn, like they dotheir divisions, or it would be just another marketing ploy.  Don\\'t get me wrong, i will be watching my car (which I do like) like ahawk for the next 4 years.  I am much more hesitant to say it (or any) caris really good, until it has proved itself to me.But since someone else pointed out C&D as a source.  I will note, becauseI used to read these magazines, that Car and Driver has never had a goodthing to say about most Chrysler products (Shadow for one), always werethey moaning about the reguritated K-car, and engine.  Whereas Motor Trendalways thought they were great cars.  No car magazine is really objective.And although there are alot of people who don\\'t like Consumers Reports, Iwill use them to reinforce my argument (I already know about the big stinkwith the Saturn crash tests, time will tell how good a car they are), theshadow/sundance rate much worse than average, in fact none of thechrysler\\'s rate a better than average, I think the best one is justaverage.  Excluding the diamond star/mitsubishi stuff and the LH\\'s.  Youcan find bad stuff about the Shadow.  Try as I might, when I researchedthe Saturn, I could not find anything bad about it.  There is a great dealof information about this company, just because it is a new americancompany and it has created quite a stir in the automotive community, forgood reason.  Much more than the introduction of any new model lines ofany established company.  I read an article, which had a sub-column, an Ithink this imprinted on me more than anything else.  Some big wig inToyota said and I quote, \"We are watching them very closely.\"  Come on,everybody grow up, the foreign cars, especially the japanese have beenkicking our butts, for good reason, the american car companies could not makea good product or support the customer the way they want these days, toset in their ways, which is one of the reasons Saturn was created.  Theyare still struggling because they haven\\'t learned yet.  They have theability, the workers are not inferior, the technology is not out of date,but their attitude is, and they are just finding this out.

Trionfo)Subject: Re: WFANOrganization: Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio (USA)Lines: 92NNTP-Posting-Host: hela.ins.cwru.edu    I hope that this comes off as a somewhat unbiased assesmentof WFAN and WIP(I go to school in Philadelphia, and I listen toboth stations on a consistant basis.)  Now that the fan has MikeLupica on from 10 to noon, they have a person who can get the big name guests for interviews, and not just of local importanceHe did have Dave Cheketts and Fred Wilpon on his show, but he had Bob Costas and Magic Johnson on too.    Now here are my opinions of the two stations competing talent:Morning show:  In my opinion, I think Imus is much better than Bruno, Cataldi, and Morganti, even though I would feel different if Morgantihad a better crew of people to work with.  To me, WIP triesto copy Imus but make it all sports as a theme.  In terms ofsports, Imus lacks the blanketing of the airwaves, but heinterjects humor and politics into his show.10 AM to 12 Noon:  I think Chuck Cooperstein and Lupica are equal in theirabilities to host a radio show, but I think Chuck has theadvantage over Lupica in terms of dealing with the callerwho is asking about who the local team is going to draftin the sixth round.  Lupica and the other hosts on FAN getbetter interview guests, but I heard the PD of WIP say thatthey were not interested in interviews with celebrities unlessit was a major story.  I would consider this even because they are two differentstyles of host.12 Noon to 2 PM:  At this point, I would have to give a big advantage to Jody McDonald over Len Berman because Lenny has only beenon for a couple of weeks.  I just think JM has the abilityto transcend the \"homer\" mentality of the Philadelphia fanbase.  This is most evident when the IGGLES(Philadelphia spelling) play the Cowboys because JM is a huge Dallas fan.Where else can you have people call up and predict a 93-0score without the egging of the hosts(re:WIP morning \\'guys\\')I do agree that JM was great on the FAN weekend overnightand I miss hearing him over the current crop of rotatinghosts.  I feel that JM is the best sportstalk host on either station by a good margin.  If you are in NY andyou can\\'t get WIP, JM does fill in on the weekends sometimes.2PM to 4PM:  This is the time when JM goes up against Francesa and Russo(fatso and froot loops) and I become the most dividedin my loyalties.  Mike and the dog are very entertaining,but they often go an hour or so without calls or even 10to 20 minutes without talking about sports.  MATD doget great guests and that is the basis for their show, soit is like the 10 to 12 debate.  Another plus is theappearances by Mike and Chris on Imus in the Morning, whichare often hilarious.  4 PM to 7 PM:  MATD go up against Fredericks and Missanelli.  I likeMike Missanelli but I just can\\'t stomach Steve Fredericks.  I know that SF came from Philly originally, but when hewas at the FAN, he was a NY homer as much as he is a Phillyhomer now.  I don\\'t listen to WIP much after 4 PM unless thereis a game on that night, but you will see later for the reason.  That is why I give the advantage to FAN.7 PM to Midnight:  S&M are on WIP until 8 and then it is the man who makesEli that calls MATD all the time seem like a novice oncharges of racism, G Cobb.  This man is so grating on mynerves that if I listen to him for a few minutes I gonuts.(I know that is biased, but listen to his show)On FAN, there is usually a game on, Knicks, Rangers, MetsJets, or St. John\\'s basketball.  If the game is on thewest coast, then it is usually Howie Rose.  Of courseI think dead air would be better than G Cobb on WIP, butWIP does air Sixers and Flyers games during the season.(If this is the sports station, why did they lose theIGGLES to WYSP(home of Howard Stern in Phil.))During the summer, itis all talk on WIP.Overall, I would have to give the advantage to WFAN, withthe exception of 10 to 12, and 2 to 4 where it is even, and12 to 2 where WIP has the advantage.

Isit because too many people take French and German in college to makethe accusations stick? (-;) was to preserve the doctors independance.Since the provincial wings of the CMA are the ones that go to bat whenthe fee schedule hikes are presented, the politically-bent doctorswere just cackling when they realized the CMA would grow in strengthrather than diminish, especially when unopposed unlike in socializedmedicine approaches like Britain\\'s National Health Service.>\"`You\\'ve got to remember, you\\'ve got a waiting list as well, but it\\'s  >not as obvious.

However, this does not refute debunkingof waiting lines for urgent AND routine care, as has been done in theU.S. by Consumers Reports, health policy studies cited by Prof. DennisE. Shea on USENET, CNN, NYT, etc.Doug Fierro has posted a NYT article from 3 weeks ago about Canada\\'shealth insurance approach, on Talk.politics.medicine.  There is onesmall error in the article: not all of our hospitals are private.>WOULDN\\'T NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE MEAN THAT AMERICANS WHO ARE NOW  >FULLY INSURED MIGHT HAVE TO SETTLE FOR LESS?  >>In Canada, provincial insurance covers all health costs except dental  >care, eyeglasses, prescription drugs, ambulance service, and private  >hospital rooms, -- so many Canadians do end up buying some private  >insurance. A policy to cover all of these things runs about #40 to $40  >a month.  Of course, the one thing to note is that in the Canada/France/Germanycase, private insurance *offloaded* the basic coverage to the publicsector.  They realized they were keeping low-risk/high-profit extrainsurance for things like private/semi-private rooms (vs. wardaccomodation), dental, glasses, etc. for corporate or personalbenefits, they\\'ll have nothing to do with you if you want to becovered for basic care.At that point, they wouldn\\'t even consider a \"voucher\" approachto broker the universal coverage and sell policies to make upthe difference in the federal guidelines and market stuff.>******************************************************************  >>WOULDN\\'T FREE CARE ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO RUN TO THE DOCTOR FOR EVERY  >ACHE AND PAIN?  >>People who get free treatment *do* go to the doctor and hospital about  >a third more often than those who have to pay a share of their medical  >bills.  >>Still, Canadians -- who pay nothing at the doctor\\'s -- have a lower  >per-person health bill than we do.It is \"free\" in that there are no deductibles nor copayments (twothings which I advocate to make the Canadian insurance look more likereal health insurance -- which actually it is).  I know that whenworking in Alberta, Ontario and Quebec, I was aware that I was payingfor health insurance - e.g., in Toronto, OHIP fees were listed on mypay stub; Manitoba did not collect at paycheque time, but onlyannually at income tax time (built into the tax rate).  Only fiscalnaifs will proclaim that it\\'s free, along with the Canadian Left forthat is part of their brainwashing agenda.The French do have copayments, though.  France Magazine\\'s Summer 1992 edition has a fantastic presentation of their basic insurancecoverage, including a sample chart of copayment percentages.  For 1-30 days, you\\'re covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100%afterward.  With extra private insurance, you can get into a privatehospital and be covered for any differences beyond the public hospitalrate.  The public insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the samecash amount for a private hospital and the difference is paidout-of-pocket or according to your supplementary private insurance.Over 2/3rds of French have some form of extra private insurance.  So,the other 30% of health costs in Europe are out of private funds, notgleaned from other taxes.  The GDP figures are combined public andprivate expenditures for total outlay using the same methods thatyield the 13-14% figure for the U.S.>ISN\\'T THE PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INDUSTRY JUST TOO BIG  >AND POWERFUL TO KILL?  >>Dismantling the health segment of our insurance industry would be  >\"politically thorny,\" in the quiet words of one advocate for a  >national plan.

You can opt out in Canadaand Germany, but you\\'ll have to go uninsured as a result becausethere are too few other people that do so --- i.e., no market.When private insurance realized how much money they\\'d make without therisks involved in basic insurance (e.g., neurosurgery) versus deluxeamenities (e.g., having to call Granada TV to replace a rental set onthe fritz in someone\\'s private hospital room), they started to patthemselves on the back for their social responsibility.  In Quebeclast spring, a consortium of private insurers publicly warned againstany thoughts of privatizing routine, low cost parts of that province\\'spublic health insurance plan.gld--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Je me souviens ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Gary L.

If sin is not part of thebasic definition of humanity, then Jesus \"fully human\" (Nicea) would notbe \"subject to sin\", but then the Resurrection loses some of its meaning,because we encounter our humanity most powerfully when we sin.

Second, the historicalrecord suggests that the positions attributed to Nestorius were not asextreme as his (successful) opponents (who wrote the conventional history)claimed.  Mainly Nestorius opposed the term Theotokos for Mary, arguing(I think correctly) that a human could not be called Mother of God.  I mean,in the Athanasian Creed we talk about the Son \"uncreate\" -- surely even Arians would concede that Jesus existed long before Mary.  Anyway, Nestorius\\'sopponents claimed that by saying Mary was not Theotokos, that he claimedthat she only gave birth to the human nature of Jesus, which would requiretwo seperate and distinct natures.  The argument fails though, becauseMary simply gave birth to Jesus, who preexisted her either divinely,if you accept \"Nestorianism\" as commonly defined, or both natures intertwined,a la Chalcedon.Second, I am not sure that \"Nestorianism\" is not a better alternative thanthe orthodox view.  After all, I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnationthat Jesus\\'s human nature was in heaven; likewise post-Ascension.  I thinkrather that God came to earth and took our nature upon him.  It was a seperatenature, capable of being tempted as in Gethsemane (since I believe the divinenature could never be tempted) but in its moments of weakness the divine natureprevailed.Comments on the above warmly appreciated.Jason Albert[There may be differences in what we mean by \"subject to sin\".  Theoriginal complaint was from someone who didn\\'t see how we could callJesus fully human, because he didn\\'t sin.  I completely agree thatJesus was subject to temptation.  I simply object to the idea that bynot succumbing, he is thereby not fully human.  I believe that you donot have to sin in order to be human.I again apologize for confusing Nestorianism and monophysitism.  Iagree with you, and have said elsewhere, that there\\'s reason to thinkthat not everyone who is associated with heretical positions was infact heretical.  There are scholars who maintain that Nestorius wasnot Nestorian.  I have to confess that the first time I read some ofthe correspondence between Nestorius and his opponents, I thought hegot the better of them.However, most scholars do believe that the work that eventually led toChalcedon was an advance, and that Nestorius was at the very least\"rash and dogmatic\" (as the editor of \"The Christological Controversy\"refers to him) in rejecting all approaches other than his own.  Asregular Usenet readers know, narrowness can be just as much animpediment as being wrong.  Furthermore, he did say some things that Ithink are problematical.  He responds to a rather mild letter fromCyril with a flame worthy of Usenet.  In it he says \"To attribute alsoto [the Logos], in the name of [the incarnation] the characteristicsof the flesh that has been conjoined with him ... is, my brother,either the work of a mind which truly errs in the fashion of theGreeks or that of a mind diseased with the insane heresy of Arius andApollinaris and the others.  Those who are thus carried away with theidea of this association are bound, because of it, to make the divineLogos have a part in being fed with milk and participate to somedegree in growh and stand in need of angelic assistance because of hisfearfulness ...  These things are taken falsely when they are put offon the deity and they become the occasion of just condemnation for uswho perpetrate the falsehood.\"It\\'s all well and good to maintain a proper distinction betweenhumanity and divinity.  But the whole concept of incarnation is basedon exactly the idea that the divine Logos does in fact have \"to somedegree\" a part in being born, growing up, and dying.  Of course itmust be understood that there\\'s a certain indirectness in the Logos\\'participation in these things.  But there must be some sort ofidentification between the divine and human, or we don\\'t have anincarnation at all.  Nestorius seemed to think in black and whiteterms, and missed the sorts of nuances one needs to deal with thisarea.You say \"I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnation that Jesus\\'shuman nature was in heaven.\"  I don\\'t think that\\'s required byorthodox doctrine.

Can anybody deny these facts?Jews killed Germans in WWII -- Germans killed Jews in WWII, BUT there was quite a difference in these two statements, regardless of what Nazi revisionists say![SY] My grand parents were living partly in todays Armenia and partly in[SY] todays Georgia. There were villages, Kurd/Turk (different Turkic groups)[SY] Georgian (muslim/christian) Armenian and Farsi... Very near to eachother.[SY] The people living there were aware of their differences. They were [SY] different people. For example, my grandfather would not have been happy [SY] if his doughter had willed to marry an Armenian guy. But that did not [SY] mean that they were willing to kill eachother. No! They were neighbors.OK.[SY] Armenians killed Turks. Which Armenians? Their neoghbors? As far as my[SY] grandparents are concerned, the Armenians attacked first but these [SY] Armenians were not their neighbors. They came from other places. Maybe [SY] first they had a training at some place. They were taught to kill people,[SY] to hate Turks/Kurds? It seems so...There is certainly a difference between the planned extermination of theArmenians of eastern Turkey beginning in 1915, with that of the Armeno-Georgian conflicts of late 1918! The argument is not whether Armenians ever killed in their collective existence, but rather the wholesale destruction ofAnatolian Armenians under orders of the Turkish government. An Armenian-Georgian dispute over the disposition of Akhalkalak, Lori, and Pambak afterthe Turkish Third Army evacuated the region, cannot be equated with theextermination of Anatolian Armenians. Many Armenians and Georgians diedin this area in the scramble to re-occupy these lands and the lack ofpreparation for the winter months. This is not the same as the Turkish genocide of the Armenians nearly four years earlier, hundreds of kilometersaway![SY] Anyway, but after they killed/raped/... Turks and other muslim people[SY] around, people assumed that \\'Armenians killed us, raped our women\\',[SY] not a particular group of people trained in some camps, maybe backed[SY] by some powerful states... After that step, you cannot explain these [SY] people not to hate all Armenians. I don\\'t follow, perhaps the next paragraph will shed some light.[SY] So what am I trying to point out? First, at least for that region,[SY] you cannot blame Turks/Kurds etc since it was a self defense situation.[SY] Most of the Armenians, I think, are not to blame either. But since some[SY] people started that fire, it is not easy to undo it. There are facts.[SY] People cannot trust eachother easily. It is very difficult to establish[SY] a good relation based on mutual respect and trust between nations with[SY] different ethnic/cultural/religious backgrounds but it is unfortunately[SY] very easy to start a fire!Again, the fighting between Armenians and Georgians in 1918/19 had little todo with the destruction of the Armenians in Turkey. It is interesting thatthe Georgian leaders of the Transcaucasian Federation (Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia) made special deals with Turkish generals not to pass through Tiflis on their way to Baku, in return for Georgians not helping the Armenians militarily. Of course, as Turkish troops marched across what was left ofCaucasian Armenia, many Armenians went north and such population movement caused problems with the locals. This is in no comparison with events 4 years earlier in eastern Anatolia. My father\\'s mother\\'s family escaped Cemiskezek -> Erzinka -> Erzerum -> Nakhitchevan -> Tiflis -> Constantinople -> Massachusetts. [SY] My grandparents were *not* bloodthirsty people. We did not experience[SY] what they had to endure... They had to leave their lands, there were[SY] ladies, old ladies, all of her children killed while she forced to[SY] witness!

I don\\'t want to go into any graphic detail.My grandmother\\'s brother was forced to dress up as a Kurdish women, and pastepotato skins on his face to look ugly. The Turks would kill any Armenianyoung man on sight in Dersim. Because their family was rather influential,local Kurds helped them escape before it was too late. This is why I am alive today.[SY] You may think that my sources are biased. They were biased in some sense.[SY] They experienced their own pain, of course. That is the way it is.

New York prohibits their use in    large trucks.  In Canada, they are illegal in Manitoba, Ontario,    Quebec, Newfoundland and PEI (Prince Edward Island).  They    are apparently are illegal through most, if not all, of Europe.    Legislation which would make them illegal is pending in many other    jurisdictions; chances of such legislation passing varies a great deal.Q:  Where are Radar Detector Detectors used?  Do they really work?A:  Usage is spreading rapidly; initially they were used only in Canada,    but now they are appearing in New York and Virginia.  It is unsafe    to assume that they are not in use in Connecticut and D.C.    They work by detecting a certain frequency radiated by many currently    available super Het radar detectors; some brands of detector radiate    more strongly than others, and are thus more likely to be spotted.    New radar detectors are becoming available which may not be detected    by the current generation of detector detectors.  Note that a    detector may only be spotted by one of these devices if it is turned    on.Q:  What is VASCAR?  Is it some kind of Radar?A:  VASCAR is nothing more than a fancy stopwatch and time-speed-distance    computer.  It depends on the operator pressing buttons as the target    vehicle passes landmarks.  No radar signals are emitted by a VASCAR    system.Q:  What is Ka band radar?  Where is it used?  Should a radar detector be    able to handle it? A:  Ka band has recently been made available by the FCC for use in the US    in so-called photo-radar installations.  In these installations, a    low-powered beam is aimed across the road at a 45 degree angle to the    direction of traffic, and a picture is taken of vehicles which the    radar unit determines to have been in violation of the speed limit.    Tickets are mailed to the owner of the vehicle.  Because of the low    power and the 45 degree angle, many people believe that a radar    detector cannot give reasonable warning of a Ka band radar unit,    although some manufacturers of radar detectors have added such    capability anyway.  The number of locales where photo-radar is in use    is limited, and some question the legality of such units.  Best advice:    learn what photo radar units look like, and keep track of where they    are used (or else, don't speed.)Q:  Do radar jammers work?  Are they legal?A:  Quick answer:  No, and Not in the USA.    Detailed answer:  Cheap radar jammers do not work well at all.    Jammers that work are expensive and usually the property of the    military.  Jammers are a major violation of the regulations of the    Federal Communications Commission of the USA.Driving technique and Vehicle Dynamics Questions:Q:  What are understeer and oversteer?A:  Understeer and oversteer are terms describing the behaviour of a    car while cornering near the `limit' (limit of adhesion, that is.)    Most drivers do not normally drive hard enough for these terms to    be descriptive of the situations they encounter.  Simply put, they    tell whether the car wants to go straight in a corner (steer `less',    or `understeer') or it wants to turn more in a corner (`oversteer'.)    Understeer is commonly designed into most production cars so that    untrained drivers, inadvertantly traveling too fast, won't get into    trouble.  Understeer may also be induced by using too much throttle    in a corner.  Oversteer is designed into some more performance    oriented cars; it may be induced by lifting on the throttle (Trailing    throttle oversteer, or TTO).  In extreme cases, lifting on the throttle    may induce so much oversteer that the car reacts by fishtailing or    spinning.    Some technical details:  in a corner at speed, the tires on the car    will develop what are called `slip angles'; the slip angle is the    angular difference between the direction that the car is traveling    and the direction that the steering wheel is directing the car to    travel.  In understeer, the front wheels have a greater slip angle    than the rear wheels.  In oversteer, the rear wheels have a greater    slip angle than the front wheels.Q: What is a rev-matched downshift?A: When downshifting, the engine must be rotating faster in the lower gear   than it was in the higher gear.  However, during a downshift, normally   you declutch and lift your foot from the throttle, so the revs drop   rather than increase.  In rev-matched downshift, you blip the throttle   before re-engaging the clutch so that the engine will already be up to   the new speed.  This results in a much smoother and faster downshift.Q: What does heel-and-toe mean?A: Heel-and-toe is a technique used to do a rev-matched downshift while   braking.  This is normally challenging, because you need the right foot   for both the brake and throttle.  It is called heel-and-toe because you   use one end of the foot on the brake, and the other on the throttle to   match revs for the downshift.  In many modern cars this is a misnomer;   often you must use the ball of the foot on the brake and the right side   on the throttle.   Note that some race car drivers will skip the clutch, and just use the   left foot on the brake and the right foot on the throttle, accomplishing   the same thing.Q: What is double-clutch downshifting?A: While your right foot is doing the above, your left foot can do one of   three things:  nothing, declutch once, or declutch twice.  The reason for   declutching twice is to match the speeds of the two shafts in the   transmission to the speed of the engine.  This is usually coupled with   rev-matching, so that while the engine is in neutral and the clutch   engaged, the throttle is blipped and both shafts of the transmission   speed up.   The procedure is as follows:   (0) declutch   (1) move gearshift lever to neutral   (2) engage clutch   (3) match revs   (4) declutch   (5) move gearshift lever to next lower gear   (6) engage clutch   This sounds like a lot of work, but with practice it becomes natural.   The problem that double-clutching solves is normally the function of the   synchronizers within the gearbox.  In transmissions without synchros or   with very worn synchros, double-clutching makes it much easier to shift.   Basically, if you double-clutch well, you are not using the synchros at   all.  This is generally unnecessary on street cars with synchros in good   condition.Q: What do the numbers for acceleration from 0-60, 1/4 mile, skidpad, and   slalom times in the Auto Magazines really mean?  May they be compared?A: In short, 1) not as much as the magazines want you to believe, and   2) almost never.   In more detail:  the acceleration numbers (0-60mph and 1/4 mile times   in the US) may be vaguely compared as long as they all come from the   same source.  Testing procedures vary so much from magazine to magazine   that comparing a Road & Track number to a Car & Driver number is quite   pointless.  Keep in mind, too, that the same variation applies from   driver to driver on the street; the driver is a major (often *the*   major) part of the equation.   Skidpads vary, and even if they didn't, skidpad figures are really   only tests of the stickiness of the stock tires; they change radically   when tire compounds change.  DO NOT make any assumptions about the   comparative handling of, say, two sports sedans based on skidpad numbers.   This is not to suggest that skidpads are without value, however. Skidpads   are an excellent educational tool at driving schools.  They are simply   of limited value in the comparison of anything except tires.   Slalom times are slightly more useful; they test some small parts of the   automobile's transient response.  However, they are also heavily influenced   by the stock rubber on the car, and they do not test many corners of the   car's envelope.  They DO NOT tell you all you need to know before making   a buying decision.  For example, they don't tell you what the rear end   of the car will do on a road which suddenly goes off-camber.  When a car   has an adjustable suspension, these tests are usually done in the `sport'   setting, which may be quite unsuitable for daily driving.  The list of   caveats could go on for page after page.Q: My buddy claims that wide tires don't make any difference, according   to his freshman physics textbook, and that you can't ever accelerate   or corner at more than 1.0G.  Does he know what he's talking about?A: 1) in short:  he hasn't got a clue.   2) in more detail: the equations for friction used in freshman physics   textbooks presume that the surfaces are smooth,  dry and non-deformable,   none of which properly apply to tire traction except in the case of a   stone cold tire on dry pavement which is far below its proper operating   temperature.   Pavement is _never_ smooth; it is always irregular to a greater or lesser   extent.  Tires, which are not really dry and solid (as rubber is a   substance which in its natural form is liquid, and which has only been   coerced into a semblance of solidity by chemical magic), deform to match   the surface of the pavement which a vehicle is traveling over.  In a tire   at operating temperature, grip is actually generated by shear stresses   inside the deformed rubber, and not by anything even remotely resembling   friction in the freshman physics sense of the term.  The colder a tire   is relative to its operating temperature, the closer its behaviour will   be to the traditional concept of friction; if much hotter than the its   proper operating temperature, the more likely the possibility of some   part of the tire actually ``reverting'' to liquid, which is mostly like   to happen deep in the tread, causing characteristic blisters and chunking.   (This latter, though, is almost completely unlikely to happen in normal   street driving, so unless you're a competition driver or do a lot of   high speed track driving, don't worry about it.)   Because tire traction is completely out of the domain of simple friction,   it does not obey the freshman physics equation at all; thus dragsters   accelerate at more than 1.0G and race cars corner and brake at more than   1.0G.  Because simple friction does not apply, it is actually possible   for different sized contact patches to generate differing amounts of   grip.  An actual analysis of tire behavior would require techniques   such as Finite Element Analysis, due to the complexity of the mechanism.Misc.

Porsche has extensive business dealings with VW/Audi,    which causes some confusion.  Since currently Porsche is in some    financial difficulty, there is a possibility that Mercedes or VW may    be interested in purchasing the company in the near future, but this    is only speculation at this time.-- richard welty        518-393-7228       welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com``Nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of  a race car about either its pitch or roll axis''  -- Carroll Smith\",\n",

It would be interesting to find a historyof scientific interpretations of the Koran, to see if anyone used the Koranto support earlier science which has since been discarded.  It is all tooeasy to look at science as it exists today and then \"interpret\" passagesto match those findings.

In other>words technically speaking Christians should use Saturday and not Sunday>as their holy day, if they want to conform to the teachings of Jesus.I think the passage you\\'re looking for is the following.Matthew 5:17    \"Think not that I have come to abolish the law and the prophets; I have come not to abolish them but to fulfil them. Matthew 5:18   For truly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the law until all is accomplished. Matthew 5:19   Whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he who does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. Matthew 5:20   For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. There are several problems with this.  The most serious is that theLaw was regarded by Jews at the time (and now) as binding on Jews, butnot on Gentiles.  There are rules that were binding on all humanbeings (the so-called Noachic laws), but they are quite minimal.  Theissue that the Church had to face after Jesus\\' death was what to doabout Gentiles who wanted to follow Christ.  The decision not toimpose the Law on them didn\\'t say that the Law was abolished.  Itsimply acknowledged that fact that it didn\\'t apply to Gentiles.  Thisis a simple answer, which I think just about everyone can agree to.(A discussion of the issue in more or less these terms is recordedin Acts 15.)However there\\'s more involved.  In order to get a full picture of therole of the Law, we have to come to grips with Paul\\'s apparentrejection of the Law, and how that relates to Jesus\\' commendation ofthe Law.  At least as I read Paul, he says that the Law serves apurpose that has been in a certain sense superceded.  Again, thisissue isn\\'t one of the abolition of the Law.  In the middle of hisdiscussion, Paul notes that he might be understood this way, andassures us that that\\'s not what he intends to say.  Rather, he seesthe Law as primarily being present to convict people of theirsinfulness.  But ultimately it\\'s an impossible standard, and one thathas been superceded by Christ.  Paul\\'s comments are not the world\\'sclearest here, and not everyone agrees with my reading.  But theinteresting thing to notice is that even this radical position doesnot entail an abolition of the Law.  It still remains as anuncompromising standard, from which not an iota or dot may be removed.For its purpose of convicting of sin, it\\'s important that it not berelaxed.  However for Christians, it\\'s not the end -- ultimately welive in faith, not Law.While the theoretical categories they use are rather different, in theend I think Jesus and Paul come to a rather similar conclusion.  Thequoted passage from Mat 5 should be taken in the context of the restof the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus shows us how he interprets theLaw.  The \"not an iota or dot\" would suggest a rather literal reading,but in fact that\\'s not Jesus\\' approach.  Jesus\\' interpretationsemphasize the intent of the Law, and stay away from the ceremonialdetails.  Indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitudetowards the Sabbath and kosher laws.  Some scholars claim that Mat5:17-20 needs to be taken in the context of 1st Cent. Jewishdiscussions.  Jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving atenth of even the most minor herbs, but neglecting the things thatreally matter: justice, mercy and faith, and caring about how cups andplates are cleaned, but not about the fact that inside the people whouse them are full of extortion and rapacity.  (Mat 23:23-25) This, andthe discussion later in Mat 5, suggest that Jesus has a very specificview of the Law in mind, and that when he talks about maintaining theLaw in its full strength, he is thinking of these aspects of it.Paul\\'s conclusion is similar.  While he talks about the Law beingsuperceded, all of the specific examples he gives involve the\"ceremonial law\", such as circumcision and the Sabbath.  He is quiteconcerned about maintaining moral standards.The net result of this is that when Paul talks about the Law beingsuperceded, and Jesus talks about the Law being maintained, I believethey are talking about different aspects of the Law.  Paul isembroiled in arguments about circumcision.  As is natural in lettersresponding to specific situations, he\\'s looking at the aspect of theLaw that is currently causing trouble: the Law as specifically Jewishceremonies.  He certainly does not intend to abolish divine standardsof conduct.  On the other hand, when Jesus commends the Law, he seemsto be talking the Law in its broadest implications for morals andhuman relationships, and deemphasizing those aspects that were laterto give Paul so much trouble.It\\'s unfortunate that people use the same terms in different ways, butwe should be familiar with that from current conflicts.  Look at theway terms like \"family values\" take on special meaning from thecurrent context.  Imagine some poor historian of the future trying tofigure out why \"family values\" should be used as a code word foropposition to homosexuality in one specific period in the U.S.  Ithink Law had taken on a similar role in the arguments Paul wasinvolved in.  Paul was clearly not rejecting all of the Jewish valuesthat go along with the term \"Law\", any more than people who concernedabout the \"family values\" movement are really opposed to familyvalues.',\n",

Lewis (faq%craft@uunet.uu.net) maintains the informative and  well written \"comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions\" document.  Its focus is on general X information, while this FAQ concentrates  on performance.  The comp.windows.x FAQ does address the issue of speed, but only with  regards to the X server.  The gist of that topic seems to be:\"Use X11R5, it is faster than R4\".  (Please see the X FAQ for complete details).---------------Window Managers---------------  There are a lot of window managers out there, with lots of different  features and abilities.  The choice of which to use is by necessity a  balancing act between performance and useful features.  At this  point, most respondents have agreed upon \"twm\" as the best candidate  for a speedy window manager.   A couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger,  is turning off unnecessary things like \"zooming\" and \"opaque move\".  Also, if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner, you reduce the  amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping  windows.                           Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)  I\\'ve found that a good font for tiling is 7x13 (aka:  -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-100-100-100-c-70-iso8859-1 ). It is  the biggest font I know of that I can use on my Sun (1152x900 screen)  and still get two 80 column terminal windows side-by-side on the  display with no overlap.  Other font suggestions will be accepted.------------The X Server------------Which Server?- - - - - - -  Make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware.  If you have a monochrome monitor, use a monochrome X11 server.  On my Monochrome Sun, I haven\\'t noticed much difference between  the Xsun (colour) server and XsunMono, however it was pointed out to  me that XsunMono is about 800k smaller and therefore should contribute  to less paging.           [ thanks to: Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk),                        Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se) ]  How your server was compiled can also make a difference.  Jeff Law  (law@schirf.cs.utah.edu) advises us that on a Sun system, X should be  compiled with gcc (version 2.*) or with the unbundled Sun compiler.  You can expect to get \"*very* large speedups in the server\" by not  using the bundled SunOS compiler.  I assume that similar results  would occur if you used one of the other high-quality commercial  compilers on the market.Locking the Server into RAM?- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  Has anyone tried hacking the X server so that it is locked into RAM and  does not get paged?  eg: via a call to plock().  Does this help  performance at all?  I\\'ve had one inquiry on this topic, and a few  pointers to the plock() function call, but no hard evidence from someone  who\\'s tried it.  I am not in a position to give it a try.    [thanks to: Eric C Claeys (ecc@eperm.att.com),      Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be),      Juan D. Martin (juando@cnm.us.es) ]Starting your Server- - - - - - - - - - -  Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :    If you start up a lot of clients in your .xsession or whatever, sleep    for a second or two after launching each one.  After I changed my    .xclients script to do this, logging in actually took *less* time...    we have a heavily loaded system without much core, though.  This sounds crazy, but I have confirmed that it works!    Warner Losh (imp@Solbourne.COM) provided me with a good explanation of  why this works, which I have summarized here:    When you start up an X server it takes a huge amount of time to    start accepting connections.  A lot of initialization is done by    the server when it starts.  This process touches a large number of    pages.  Any other process running at the same time would fight the    server for use of the CPU, and more importantly, memory.  If you    put a sleep in there, you give the Server a chance to get itself    sorted out before the clients start up.    Similarly, there is also a lot of initialization whenever an X    client program starts: toolkits registering widgets, resources    being fetched, programs initializing state and \"databases\" and so    forth.  All this activity is typically memory intensive.  Once this    initialization is done (\"The process has reached a steady state\"),    the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages.    By using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your    .Xinitrc , you avoid them fighting each other for your    workstation\\'s limited resources  This is most definitely a \"Your Mileage May Vary\" situation, as there  are so many variables to be considered: available RAM, local swap  space, load average, number of users on your system, which clients  you are starting, etc.  Currently in my .xinitrc I have a situation like:(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &  I\\'ve experimented with:(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &(sleep 2; exec xbiff ) &(sleep 3; exec xterm ) &(sleep 4; exec xterm ) &  I\\'ve even tried:(sleep 2; exec start_X_clients_script ) &  and then in start_X_clients_script I had:(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &    [ The idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had    completely finished processing my .xinitrc, and had settled down    into a \"steady state\" before the sleep expired and all my clients    were launched. ]  All of these yielded fairly comparable results, and so I just stuck with  my current setup, for its simplicity.  You will probably have to  experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you.Fonts- - -  Loading fonts takes time and RAM.  If you minimize the number of fonts  your applications use, you\\'ll get speed increases in load-up time.  One simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts (one small, one  large, one roman, whatever suits you) and configure all your clients -- or  at least all your heavily used clients -- to use only those few fonts.  Client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded  into the server.  This will also conserve server resources, since fewer  fonts will be loaded by the server.      [ Farrell McKay (fbm@ptcburp.ptcbu.oz.au),        Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) ]  eg: My main xterm font is 7x13, so I also have twm set up to use 7x13  in all it\\'s menus and icons etc.  Twm\\'s default font is 8x13.  Since  I don\\'t normally use 8x13, I\\'ve eliminated one font from my server.  Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com):    Keep fonts local to the workstation, rather than loading them over nfs.    If you will make extensive use of R5 scalable fonts, use a font server.About the Resources File- - - - - - - - - - - - -    Keep your .Xresources / .Xdefaults file small.  Saves RAM and saves    on server startup time.          Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)  One suggestion:    In your .Xdefaults (.Xresources) file, try putting only the minimum    number of resources that you want to have available to all of your    applications.  For example:  *reverseVideo: true    Then, separate your resources into individual client-specific    resource files.  For example: $HOME/lib/app-defaults.  In your    .login file set the environment variable XUSERFILESEARCHPATH:setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH $HOME/lib/app-defaults/%N    [ The \"comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions\" FAQ contains    an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work.    --ed.]    So, when xterm launches, it loads its resources from    .../app-defaults/XTerm.  Xdvi finds them in .../app-defaults/XDvi,    and so on and so forth.  Note that not all clients follow the same    XXxxx resource-file naming pattern.  You can check in your system    app-defaults directory (often: /usr/X11R5/lib/X11/app-defaults/) to    find the proper name, and then name your personal resource files    with the same name.    This is all documented in the Xt Specification (pg 125 & 666).    [Thanks to: Kevin Samborn (samborn@mtkgc.com),         Michael Urban (urban@cobra.jpl.nasa.gov),             and Mike Long (mikel@ee.cornell.edu).     Kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers.]  This method of organizing your personal resources has the following  benefits:    - Easier to maintain / more usable.    - Fewer resources are stored in the X server in the RESOURCE_MANAGER      property.  As a side benefit your server may start fractionally      quicker, since it doesn`t have to load all your resources.    - Applications only process their own resources, never have to sort       through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them.  It also has drawbacks:    - the application that you are interested in has to load an      additional file every time it starts up.  This doesn\\'t seem to      make that much of a performance difference, and you might      consider this a huge boon to usability.  If you are modifying an      application\\'s resource database, you just need to re-run the      application without having to \"xrdb\" again.    - xrdb will by default run your .Xdefaults file through cpp.  When      your resources are split out into multiple resource files and      then loaded by the individual client programs, they will not.      WATCH OUT FOR THIS!!      I had C style comments in my .Xdefaults file, which cpp stripped      out.  When I switched to this method of distributed resource      files I spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why      my clients were not finding their resources.  Xt did *NOT*      provide any error message when it encountered the C style      comments in the resource files, it simply, silently, aborted      processing the resource file.      The loss of preprocessing (which can be very handy, e.g. ``#ifdef      COLOR\\'\\' ...) is enough to cause some people to dismiss this      method of resource management.    - You may also run into some clients which break the rules.  For      example, neither Emacs (18.58.3) nor Xvt (1.0) will find their      resources if they are anywhere other than in .Xdefaults.    - when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files      with the machine where your resources are stored, your client      will not find its resources.  Loading all your resources into the      server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find      their resources.            Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov)  A possible compromise suggestion that I have (and am planning on trying)  is to put resources for all my heavily used clients (eg: xterm) into my  .Xdefaults file, and to use the \"separate resources files\" method for  clients that I seldom use.Define Your Display Properly- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  Client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server.  In  that situation, rather than setting your DISPLAY environment variable to   \"<hostname>:0.0\", where <hostname> is the name of your workstation, you  should set your DISPLAY variable to \"unix:0.0\" or \":0.0\".  By doing this  you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same  machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests.[thanks to Patrick J Horgan (pjh70@ras.amdahl.com)]  See the _DISPLAY NAMES_ section of the X(1) man page for further  explanation of how to properly set your display name.  \"I don\\'t think it\\'s stock MIT, but (at least) Data General and HP have  libraries that are smart enough to use local communication even when  the DISPLAY isn\\'t set specially.\"      Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET)  [Jody Goldberg (jody@algorithmics.com) sent me an Xlib patch to change  stock R5 to use local communication even if DISPLAY is not properly set.  I don\\'t want to get in the business of distributing or trying to juggle  non-MIT patches and so have elected not to include it here.  Hopefully MIT  will apply this minor (~8 lines) patch themselves.  In the meantime, if  you want to try it yourself, email Jody.  --ed.]-------Clients-------  If you only have a few megabytes of Ram then you should think  carefully about the number of programs you are running.  Think also  about the _kind_ of programs you are running.  For example:  Is there  a smaller clock program than xclock?  Unfortunately, I haven\\'t really noticed that programs advertise how large  they are, so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word.  [ Suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients  (eg: Xclock, Xterm, Xbiff) are welcome.  --ed.]  I\\'ve received some contradictory advice from people, on the subject  of X client programs.  Some advocate the use of programs that are  strictly Xlib based, since Xt, Xaw and other toolkits are rather  large.  Others warn us that other applications which you are using  may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries.  In  this case, using a non-Xt (for example) client program may actually  _increase_ the amount of RAM consumed.  The upshot of all this seems to be: Don\\'t mix toolkits.  That is, try  and use just Athena clients, or just Xview clients (or just Motif  clients, etc).  If you use more than one, then you\\'re dragging in  more than one toolkit library.  Know your environment, and think carefully about which client  programs would work best together in that environment.

I suspect that  xterm is one of the most used clients at many, if not most sites.  Laziness?  Isn\\'t there a better terminal emulator available?  See below.  If you must use xterm, you can try reducing the number of saveLines  to reduce memory usage.  [ Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com),   Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk) ]1) Xvt   suggested by: Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) :   available: export.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib/xvt-1.0.tar.Z   \"...if you don\\'t need all the esoteric features of xterm, then get   hold of xvt ...  it was written here just to save swap space as   xterm is rather a hog! \"   This was written as a partial \\'clone\\' of xterm.  You don\\'t have to   rename your resources, as xvt pretends to be XTerm.  In it\\'s current   version, you cannot bind keys as you can in xterm.  I\\'ve heard that   there are versions of xvt with this feature, but I\\'ve not found any   yet.   UPDATE (March 1993):  I recently had a few email conversations with   Brian Warkentin (brian.warkentine@eng.sun.com) regarding xvt.  He   questions whether xvt really is at all faster than xterm.  For   instance, xvt may initialize slightly faster, but compare scrolling   speed (try this quickie benchmark: /bin/time dd if=/etc/termcap   bs=40) and see which program can scroll faster.  Also, while xterm   may be slightly larger in RAM requirements (We don\\'t have any hard   numbers here, does anyone else?) shared libraries and shared text   segments mean that xterm\\'s paging requirements are not that major.   As an experiment, he ripped out all the tek stuff from xterm, but it   made little difference, since if you never use it, it never gets   brought into memory.   So here we stand with some conflicting reports on the validity of   xvt over xterm.  In summary?  Caveat Emptor, your mileage may vary.   If you can provide some hard data, I\\'d like to see it.

Its major lack is   scrollback, but some people like it anyway.\"Tuning your client- - - - - - - - - -  Suggestions on how you can tune your client programs to work faster.  From Scott Barman (scott@asd.com) comes a suggestion regarding Motif  Text Field Widgets:    I noticed that during data entry into Motif text field widgets, I    was getting a slight lag in response to some keystrokes,    particularly the initial one in the field.  Examining the what was    going on with xscope I found it.  It seems that when the resource    XmNblinkRate is non-zero and the focus is on a text field widget    (or even just a text widget) the I-beam cursor will blink.    Every time the cursor appears or disappears in those widgets, the    widget code is making a request to the server (CopyArea).  The user    can stop this by setting the resource XmNblinkRate to 0.  It is not    noticeable on a 40MHz SPARC, but it does make a little difference    on a [slower system].  This specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots  of areas.  Consider your heavily used clients, are there any minor  embellishments that can be turned off and thereby save on Server  requests?-------------------------Miscellaneous Suggestions-------------------------Pretty Pictures- - - - - - - -  Don\\'t use large bitmaps (GIF\\'s, etc) as root window backgrounds.  - The more complicated your root window bitmap, the slower the server    is at redrawing your screen when you reposition windows (or redraw, etc)  - These take up RAM, and CPU power.  I work on a Sun SPARC and I\\'m    conscious of performance issues, I can\\'t comprehend it when I see    people with a 4mb Sun 3/60 running xphoon as their root window.    I\\'ll let someone else figure out how much RAM would be occupied by    having a full screen root image on a colour workstation.  - If you\\'re anything like me, you need all the screen real estate    that you can get for clients, and so rarely see the root window anyway.      [ Thanks to Qiang Alex Zhao (azhao@cs.arizona.edu) for reminding me of this one. --ed.]A Quicker Mouse- - - - - - - -  Using xset, you can adjust how fast your pointer moves on the screen  when you move your mouse.  I use \"xset m 3 10\" in my .xinitrc file,  which lets me send my pointer across the screen with just a flick of  the wrist.  See the xset man page for further ideas and information.  Hint: sometimes you may want to *slow down* your mouse tracking for  fine work.  To cover my options, I have placed a number of different  mouse setting commands into a menu in my window manager.    e.g. (for twm) :      menu \"mouse settings\" {        \"Mouse Settings:\"f.title\"  Very Fast\"! \"xset m 7 10 &\"\"  Normal (Fast)\"! \"xset m 3 10 &\"\"  System Default (Un-Accelerated)\"! \"xset m default &\"\"  Glacial\"! \"xset m 0 10 &\"      }Programming Thoughts- - - - - - - - - - -  Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :    To speed up applications that you\\'re developing, there are tons of    things you can do.  Some that stick out:    - For Motif programs, don\\'t set XmFontList resources for individual      buttons, labels, lists, et. al.; use the defaultFontList or      labelFontList or whatever resource of the highest-level manager      widget.  Again, stick to as few fonts as possible.    - Better yet, don\\'t use Motif at all.  It\\'s an absolute pig.    - Don\\'t create and destroy widgets on the fly.  Try to reuse them.      (This will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits, too.)    - Use a line width of 0 in GCs.  On some servers this makes a HUGE      difference.    - Compress and collapse multiple Expose events.  This can make the      difference between a fast application and a completely unusable      one.  Francois Staes (frans@kiwi.uia.ac.be) :    Just a small remark: I once heard that using a better malloc    function would greatly increase performance of Xt based    applications since they use malloc heavily. They suggested trying    out the GNUY malloc, but I didn\\'t find the time yet. I did some    tests on small programs just doing malloc and free, and the    differences were indeed very noticeable ( somewhat 5 times faster)  [ Any confirmation on this from anyone?  --ed.]  Andre\\' Beck (Andre_Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de) :  - Unnecessary NoExpose Events.    Most people use XCopyArea/XCopyPlane as fastest blit routines, but    they forget to reset graphics_exposures in the GC used for the    blits. This will cause a NoExpose Event every blit, that, in most    cases, only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to    run through it\\'s event-loop again and again.  - Thousands of XChangeGC requests.    This \"Gfx Context Switching\" is also seen in most handcoded X-Apps,    where only one or few GCs are created and then heavily changed    again and again.  Xt uses a definitely better mechanism, by caching    and sharing a lot of GCs with all needed parameters. This will    remove the load of subsequent XChangeGC requests from the    connection (by moving it toward the client startup phase).Say What!?- - - - - -   Some contributors proposed ideas that seem right off the wall at first:  David B. Lewis (by day: dbl@osf.org, by night: david%craft@uunet.uu.net) :    How about this: swap displays with someone else. Run all your programs    on the other machine and display locally; the other user runs off your    machine onto the other display. Goal: reduce context switches in the    same operation between client and server.  I\\'m not in a situation where I can easily try this, but I have received  the following confirmation...  Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se):    I regularly run programs on other machines and I notice a big    difference. I try to run on a machine where I will reduce net usage    and usually with nice to reduce the impact of my intrusion. This    helps a lot on my poor little SS1+ with only 16 MB, it was    essential when I only had 8 MB.  Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov) :    [The X11 Server and the client are] competing for the same CPU as    your server when you run it on the same machine.  Not really a    major problem, except that the X11 client and the server are in    absolute synchronicity and are context thrashing.  Timothy H Panton (thp@westhawk.uucp) :    Firstly it relies on the fact that most CPU\\'s are mostly idle, X\\'s    cpu usage is bursty.  so the chances of you and your teammate    doing something cpu-intensive at the same time is small. If they    are not then you get twice the cpu+memory available for your    action.    The second factor is that context switches are expensive, using 2    cpu\\'s halves them, you pay a price due to the overhead of going    over the network, but this is offset in most cases by the improved    buffering of a network (typically 20k vs 4k for a pipe), allowing    even fewer context switches.----------------------------Other Sources of Information----------------------------  Volume 8 in O\\'Reilly\\'s X Window System Series, ``X Window System  Administrator\\'s Guide\\'\\' is a book all X administrator\\'s should read.

The earlier cars (pre 74-1/2) are usually more desirable due to certain things that went with having chrome bumpers (ride height, generally more power).  The older cars are appreciating... slowly.  The newer ones seem to be at a stable level at the moment.  $6 to $8k would require extremely good condition and low miles.If the car is in good shape and regular maintenance is kept up on it, the car should last for a long time.  There are still plenty of parts sources ouththere.  The MGB is a great, fun little car.  If she is keeping it solely in the hopes that it is going to appreciate, tell her to sell it.  It is not worth waiting the time it would take to appreciate to a real profitable level.****************************************************************************Rick Guynn -MG driver soontobe.  *  MGA 1600 MkII                        **RCG1597@zeus.tamu.edu            *  Rebuild (complete) to be finished ?? **Texas A&M University             *                                       **Keeper of the eternal octagon    *  `69 MGB Roadster                     ** a.k.a.

       " 'From: f2ehg786@umiami.ir.miami.eduSubject: Disappointed by La CieOrganization: Univ of Miami IRLines: 52Approximately four months ago, I purchased a Quantum 240LPS HD from La Cie for$649. After two months, the drive started having problems. First, there wereintermittent freezes, then corrupted files and resources, then Silverlining5.41 wouldn\\'t even recognize the drive. So I got an RMA from La Cie andexchanged the new drive for a reconditioned one.Well, about a month has passed now and the second drive is having problems.Often, when I boot up my IIsi I get the flashing question mark. Sometimes, if Ithen insert the Silverlining (5.42) program I can get it to recognize the driveby making it scan over and over for drives. At that point I can restart theIIsi and boot from the HD. I\\'ve called La Cie again and they\\'ve given meanother RMA. Their tech support people tell me that if Silverlining doesn\\'t seethe drive there\\'s a definite hardware problem.Given that this is the second bad drive in four months, I asked La Cie to sendme a *new* one, but they said \"no.\" Also, within three weeks after I purchasedmy original drive, La Cie dropped the price on it by over $100.I can accept that a drive (or two) may be bad. And I know that hardware vendorsmake a practice of sending reconditioned replacements when they do repairs. AndI understand that the nature of the computer industry lends itself to suddenprice fluctuations. Nevertheless, taken together, the convergence of thesefacts/events have left a bad taste in my mouth. (I should have added above thatwhen I asked La Cie to transfer the contents of my current drive to the onethey will send_I think the data is still in good shape and I\\'ll have to againreinstall everything from floppies_they said it would cost me $250 for datarecovery.)It seems to me that reconditioned hardware should be sold as reconditioned at adiscounted price, and that replacements for new hardware gone bad (stillcovered under a 90-day warranty) should be new. I feel a little helpless about all this. I don\\'t mean to necessarily flame LaCie_their support staff have always been friendly and sometimes even helpful.But c\\'mon. Sometimes a little extra customer service goes a long way. (I senta letter to La Cie\\'s customer service when the first drive was returned and Iasked them for a credit on the price difference since I had purchased the drivethree weeks before they slashed the price. I told them I would like to applythe credit toward the purchase of another La Cie product. They didn\\'t even have the courtesy to reply one way or the other.)What\\'s the moral of this story? I\\'m not sure. But I do know I won\\'t buy anyother products from La Cie in the future.Bill Krauthammerf2ehg786@umiami.ir.miami.eduPS Please don\\'t email or post about how good your La Cie product and servicehas been. I\\'m not suggesting that they are not a good company or anything likethat. All I\\'m saying is that I\\'ve had a disappointing experience with them andI\\'ll be taking my business elsewhere in the future.',\n",

Although this case did not pertain to firearms, Justice Rhenquist    notes that the term \"the people\" is a term of art conveying individual    rights, and specifically cited several used, 2nd ammentment included,    in his opinion.  - Title 10, U.S. Code.  This states that all males between the ages of    18 & 45 not part of the organized militia, and all female officers of    the national guard are part of the unorganized militia.Feel free to cite any scholarly and historical references you have tosupport your position.  I could go on a greater length with my personalproof by assertion, however, such a technique would carry no more orless weight that your dubious proofs by assertion.',\n",

Hence, any apparent>similarity in handling characteristics may, or may *not* be analagous>in its underlying physics to that behind motorcycle handling>characteristics.OK, as one last attempt, I\\'ll take a different tack.We all seem to be in agreement that there are two explanations for whyone can use the handlebars to lean a moving motorcycle. The question is,is one of the effect dominant, and which one is it? The idea would be todesign an experiment which would seaprate the two characteristics, andsee which effect produces a similar result to the one with which those ofus who have bikes are familiar.Let\\'s look at the one that, so far, has sparked no controversy on itsown, gyroscopic precession. To examine this alone, we would have toget rid of the contact patch effect, by not allowing the contact patchesto transmit any force. The wheels and steering mechanism would have toremain, and be attached to a vehicle with about the same weight as a bike,through suspension (so that the wheels transmit forces to the bike thesame way) similar to a bikes. An experiment would be to ride a bike along a dry road to get moving and to get the wheels spinning, then change surfaces to something that won\\'t transmit forces through the contact patches, and try a steering manoeuvre to see if the bike leans. It probably would, since some of us know how easy it is to fall down on ice, but we wouldn\\'t get a good idea of how well or what it feels like because, without the contact patches, we can\\'t turn.  Maybe there\\'s a better way. Besides, even ice doesn\\'t get rid of the contact patchforces altogether, so we\\'d have to find a really frictionless surface.You\\'d have to try it again with the wheels locked to really know if itwas the rotation that did it.Looking at the contact-patch effect only, however, is fairly simple.Now we have to find a vehicle that gets the about the same magnitude anddirection of cantact patch forces as a motorcycle, and transmits themabout the same way to the vehicle, but without rotating wheels.How it gets the contact patch forces is irrelevant, we\\'re just lookingfor something that has contact patches that can go straight and notsideways, and skis or skates would do fine. I don\\'t know of any snow-skior skate bikes, but up here we have the Suzuki Wetbike that is arrangedlike a motorcycle but has fat water skis where there should be wheels.I think the propellor is in front of the rear ski, or something likethat, but we could try it at a coast to get rid of most of its effect.Now I admit that this is second hand info (although I\\'d love to tryone of these), but the review in the local cycle rag and a guy ina bike shop that sells them both say that this machine handles verymuch like a motorcycle, in that you countersteer it to turn.So we have contact patches that transmit similar forces to a bike\\'s,a similar suspension arrangement, and no gyroscopes, but we do havecountersteering.Conclusion: you don\\'t need gyroscopes to countersteer vehicles that havemotorcycle-like contact patch arrangements. We still don\\'t know whatreal effect the gyroscopes have when they\\'re there, but from my observationsof how handlebar angle, force, etc. relate to steering in general, I\\'m willing to bet that they\\'re not the dominant factor in countersteering. If you don\\'t like this conclusion, then don\\'t accept it, but my motorcycle\\'sbehaviour is consistent with it.

No matter how \"absurd\" it is to suggest that a common moral system created bymankind is absolute, it is not contrary to reason to suggest that a commonmoral system created by mankind is sensible. In fact, for the Bible to be ofany use to mankind as a moral code, it must be interpreted by mankind and aworkable moral system created for everyday use.The Jewish Talmud is the result of centuries of Biblical scholars analysingevery word of the Torah to understand the morality behind it. The Children ofIsrael were given a very strict set of Moral, Civil, Judicial and CeremonialLaws to follow and yet this was clearly not enough to cover every instanceof moral dilemma in their Society. For a Christian, the situation is no better.It seems to me that the only code of morality that we have from the Judeo-Christian God is that which is contained in the Bible (which we can see fromthe diverse opinions in the Christian newsgroups is not clear). There may wellbe an absolute morality defined by the Judeo-Christian God for mankind tofollow but it seems that we only have a subset simply because the concept waswritten down by man.This leads to the problem of defining morality for our society. If we take thedivine Morality then we have a code of practice which may be interpreted in manydifferent ways (as an example, consider the immolation of heretics in thefifteenth century and the interpretation of the Bible which allows a man to dothat to another man under the precept to administer Justice). If we take anagnostic Morality then we have a code of practice that can be modified to suitsociety (with all the danger that this implies). Alternatively, we could takethe basis of the Judeo-Christian morality and interpret/extend this to createand justify a code of morality which suits the society we live in and enablesthe people to live Righteously (as many Christian and Non-Christian philosophershave done).Whatever the driving force behind the definition of morality for our society, Ithink the important aspect is the result.David.---On religion:\"Oh, where is the sea?\", the fishes cried,As they swam its clearness through.',\n",

Atnuclear plants it is prefered to run the water closed cycle, whereasfossil fuel plants can in some cases get away with dumping the hotwater.  As I recall the water isn\\'t as hot (thermodynamically) in manyfossil fuel plants, and of course there is less danger of radioactivecontamination.Wayne Martin',\n",

Richard Hirschhaut, director of the San Francisco branch of the ADL, artdealer Roy Bullock and former policeman Tom Gerard were also named as defendantsin the suit, filed in San Francisco County Superior Court.     The 19 accuse the ADL of B\\'nai B\\'rith, a group dedicated to fightinganti-Semitism, and the other defendants of secretly gathering information onthem, including data from state and federal agencies.     The suit alleges they disclosed the information to others, including thegovernments of Israel and South Africa, in what it alleges was a \"a massivespying operation.\"     The action is a class-action suit. It was filed on behalf of about 12,000anti-apartheid activists or opponents of Israeli policies about whom theplaintiffs believe the ADL, Bullock and Gerard gathered information.     Representatives of the ADL in San Francisco were not immediately availablefor comment on Wednesday.     The civil suit is the first legal action arising out of allegations thatGerard, a former inspector in the San Francisco police intelligence unit, passedconfidential police files on California political activists to a spy ring.     The FBI and San Francisco police are investigating the ADL, Bullock andGerard over the affair and last week searched the ADL\\'s offices in San Franciscoand Los Angeles.     The suit alleges invasion of privacy under the Civil Code of California,which prohibits the publication of information obtained from official sources.It seeks exemplary damages of at least $2,500 per person as well as otherunspecified damages.     Lawyer Pete McCloskey, a former Congresmen who is representing theplaintiffs, said the 19 plaintiffs included Arab-Americans and Jews -- and hiswife Helen, who also had information gathered about her.     One of the plaintiffs is Yigal Arens, a research scientist at theUniversity of Southern California who is a son of the former Israeli DefenceMinister.     Arens told the San Francisco Examiner he had seen a file the ADL kept onhim in the 1980s, presumably because of his criticism of the treatment ofPalestinians and his position on the Israeli-occupied territories.     According to court documents released last week, Bullock and Gerard bothkept information on thousands of California political activists.     In the documents, a police investigator said he believed the ADL paidBullock for many years to provide information and that both the league andBullock received confidential information from the authorities.     No criminal charges have yet been filed in the case. The ADL, Bullock andGerard have all denied any wrongdoing.  REUTER AC KG CMAPn  04/14 2202  ADL LawsuitCopyright, 1993. The Associated Press. All rights reserved.By CATALINA ORTIZ Associated Press Writer   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Arab-Americans and critics of Israel sued theAnti-Defamation League on Wednesday, saying it invaded their privacy byillegally gathering information about them through a nationwide spy network.   The ADL, a national group dedicated to fighting anti-Semitism, intended touse the data to discredit them because of their political views, according tothe class-action lawsuit filed in San Francisco Superior Court.   \"None of us has been guilty of racism or Nazism or anti-Semitism or hatecrimes, or any of the other `isms\\' that the ADL claims to protect against. Noneof us is violent or criminal in any way,\" said Carol El-Shaieb, an educationconsultant who develops programs on Arab culture.   The 19 plaintiffs include Yigal Arens, son of former Israel Defense MinisterMoshe Arens. The younger Arens, a research scientist at the University ofSouthern California, said the ADL kept a file on him in the 1980s presumablybecause he has criticized Israel\\'s treatment of Palestinians.   \"The ADL believes that anyone who is an Arab American ... or speakspolitically against Israel is at least a closet anti-Semite,\" Arens said.   The ADL has denied any wrongdoing, but couldn\\'t comment on the lawsuitbecause it hasn\\'t reviewed it, said a spokesman at the ADL\\'s New Yorkheadquarters.   The FBI and local police and prosecutors are investigating allegations thatthe ADL spied on thousands of individuals and hundreds of groups, includingwhite supremacist and anti-Semitic organizations, Arab-Americans, Greenpeace,the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and San Franciscopublic television station KQED.   Some information allegedly came from confidential police and governmentrecords, according to court documents filed in the probe and the civil lawsuit.No charges have been filed in the criminal investigation.   The lawsuit accuses the ADL of violating California\\'s privacy law, whichforbids the intentional disclosure of personal information \"not otherwisepublic\" from state or federal records.   The lawsuit claims the ADL disclosed the information to \"persons andentities\" who had no compelling need to receive it. It didn\\'t elaborate.   Defendants include Richard Hirschhaut, director of the ADL\\'s office in SanFrancisco. He did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment.   Other defendants are San Francisco art dealer Roy Bullock, an alleged ADLinformant over the past four decades, and former police officer Tom Gerard.Gerard allegedly tapped into law enforcement and government computers and passedinformation on to Bullock.   Gerard, who has retired from the police force, has moved to the Philippines.Bullock\\'s lawyer, Richard Breakstone, said he could not comment on the lawsuitbecause he had not yet studied it.UPwe 04/14 1956  ADL sued for allegedly spying on U.S. residents   SAN FRANCISCO (UPI) -- A group of California residents filed suit Wednesdaycharging the Anti-Defamation League of B\\'nai Brith with violating their privacyby spying on them for the Israeli and South African governments.   The class-action suit, filed in San Francisco Superior Court, charges the ADLand its leadership conspired with a local police official to obtain informationon outspoken opponents of Israeli policies towards the Occupied Territories andSouth Africa\\'s apartheid policy.   The ADL refused to comment on the suit.   The suit also took aim at two top local ADL officials and retired SanFrancicso police officer Tom Gerard, claiming they violated privacy guaranteesin the state constitution and violated state confidentiality laws.   According to the suit, Gerard helped the ADL obtain access to confidentialfiles in law enforcement and government computers. Information from these fileswere passed to the foreign governments, the suit charges.   \"The whole concept of an organized collection of information based onpolitical viewpoints and using government agencies as a source of information isabsolutely repugnant,\" said former Rep. Pete McCloskey, who is representing theplaintiffs.   The ADL\\'s information-gathering network was revealed publicly last week whenthe San Francisco District Attorney\\'s Office released documents indicating thegroup had spied on 12,000 people and 500 political and ethnic groups for morethan 30 years.   \"My understanding is that they (the ADL) consider all activity that is insome sense opposed to Israel or Israeli action to be part of their responsbilityto investigate,\" said Arens, a research scientist at the University of SouthernCalifornia.   \"The ADL believes that anyone who is Arab American...or speaks politicallyagainst Israel is at least a closet anti-Semite.\"   The FBI and the District Attorney\\'s Office have been investigating theoperation for four months.   The 19 plaintiffs in the case include Arens, the son of former IsraeliDefense Minister Moshe Arens.   In a press release, the plaintiffs said the alleged spying had damaged thempsychologically and economically and accused the ADL of trying to interfere withtheir freedom of speech.',\n",

       " 'From: jayne@mmalt.guild.org (Jayne Kulikauskas)Subject: What\\'s in a name?: the sequelOrganization: Kulikauskas homeLines: 57I\\'ve been thinking about the idea that was raised (by Michael Covington, I think) that words mean what we think they mean, regardless of etymology.  I\\'ve been reflecting on what certain words meant in my childhood and tracing how this shaped some of my attitudes. I grew up in a home where Christ was a bad word.  People who were very angry said it.  The word Christian meant someone who was not a Jew.  It carried connotations of otherness, of threat, of enemy.  It took some time to figure out that there was a connection between `Christ\\' and `Christian\\'.  When I accepted Jesus, I expected to be disowned.  To become a Christian meant to join the enemy.  I knew others would consider me a traitor.  At some level, I agreed, but was still prepared to pay this price.  Like Esau, I sold my birthright.  However, I made a better bargain.  He only got some stew, but I got the incomparable riches of knowing Christ.As it turned out, my parents did not disown me.  I found out later that they were hoping it was a phase that I would grow out of.  By the time they had decided it wasn\\'t a phase, they were sort of used to it.  They didn\\'t disown me but they didn\\'t completely accept the situation either.  For example, they didn\\'t come to my wedding because it was in a church.   When I visited my grandmother in the hospital a few days before her death, she said to me, \"As far as I\\'m concerned, you still are a Jew.\" What she meant was that she loved me and forgave me.  But I am not a Jew.  I am a Christian.  (I\\'ll concede, one that likes chicken soup with matzoh balls.:-)) I do not keep kosher.  I do not celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday.  My sons are not circumcised.  But these things are true of some people who do consider themselves Jews.  It is not these rules that make people Jews; it is the heritage from the past.  I gave up the past.This is why I find it hard to relate to Messianic Jews.  Their experience is unlike mine.  They still consider themselves Jews while following Jesus.  Some would even say that I *must* do so, too.  I am at a stage of my life now where I would like to have a heritage.  It was not something I valued very much when I gave it.  But I did have a sense that I was giving it for God.  It may have been a small sacrifice.  It may have been an unnecessary sacrifice.  But I gave it and do not want to ask for it back.And while I don\\'t have the heritage I was born with, I do have another.  I am an outcast from the house of Israel, but I am a member of the Church.  One of the things I like about being a Catholic Christian is that it is rich in tradition.  It gives me a feeling of, once again, being rooted in the past. This is probably one of the reasons why I don\\'t like it when people mess around with Christian traditions (for example, changing the name of Easter).  These traditions fill an important emotional need of mine.I suppose the point of all this is that people shouldn\\'t assume that all believers of Jewish background are the same.  For some `Jewish Christian\\' is a good name, for others it is an oxymoron. Jayne Kulikauskas/jayen@mmalt.guild.org',\n",

Well, despite what my mother told me about accepting dares, here goes. You have to be very careful about what you mean by \"question authority\".Taken literally, it is nonsense. That which is authoratative is authoratative,and to say \"I question to word of this authority\" is ridiculous. If it is open to question, it isn\\'t an authority. On the other hand, it is perfectlyreasonable to question whether something is an authority. The catch phrasehere should be \"authenticate authority.\" Once you have authenticatedyour authority, you must believe what it says, or you are not treating it asan authority. The difficulty is that authenticating an authority is not easy. You can perhaps discredit a claim to authority by showing logical inconsistencyin what it teaches, or by showing that it does not obey its own rules ofdiscourse. But the fact that I cannot discredit something does not, ininself, accredit it. (Nor does the fact that I can convince myself and other that I have discredited something necessarilly mean that it is false.)I cannot accredit an authority by independantly verifying its teachings, because if I can independantly verify its teachings, I don\\'t need an authority. I need an authority only when there is information I need whichI cannot get for myself. Thus, if I am to authenticate an authority, I mustdo it by some means other than by examining its teachings. In practical matters we accept all kinds of authorities because we don\\'thave time to rediscover fundamental knowledge for ourselves. Every scientistworing today assumes, on the authority of the scintific community, all sortsof knowledge which is necessary to his work but which he has not time to verify for himself.In spiritual matters, we accept authority because we have no direct source ofinformation. We select our authorities based on various criteria. (I ama Catholic, in part, because the historical claims of the RC church seemthe strongest.) Without authorities there would be no subject matter forbelief, unless we simply made something up for ourselves (as many do).The atheist position seems to be that there are no authorities. This is areasonable assertion in itself, but it leads to a practical difficulty.If you reject all authority out of hand, you reject all possibility ofevery receiving information. Thus the atheist position can never possiblychange. It is non-falsifiable and therefore unscintific. To demand scintific or rational proof of God\\'s existence, is to denyGod\\'s existence, since neither science, nor reason, can, in their verynature, prove anything.-- ==============================================================================Mark Baker                  | \"The task ... is not to cut down jungles, but aa888@Freenet.carleton.ca   | to irrigate deserts.\" -- C.

Thus while I believe that no gods exist, this does                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> not imply *faith* on my part that it is so.  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Let me first say that \"to believe that no gods exist\" is in fact different than \"not believing in a god or gods\". I will argue that your latter statement, \"I believe that no gods exist\"does rest upon faith - that is, if you are making a POSITIVE statement that \"no gods exist\" (strong atheism) rather than merely saying I don\\'t  know and therefore don\\'t believe in them and don\\'t NOT believe in then(weak atheism). Once again, to not believe in God is different than saying  I BELIEVE that God does not exist. I still maintain the position, even after reading the FAQs, that strong atheism requires faith.But first let me say the following.We might have a language problem here - in regards to \"faith\" and\"existence\". I, as a Christian, maintain that God does not exist.To exist means to have being in space and time. God does not HAVEbeing - God IS Being. Kierkegaard once said that God does notexist, He is eternal. With this said, I feel it\\'s rather pointlessto debate the so called \"existence\" of God - and that is not whatI\\'m doing here. I believe that God is the source and ground ofbeing. When you say that \"god does not exist\", I also accept thisstatement - but we obviously mean two different things by it. However,in what follows I will use the phrase \"the existence of God\" in it\\'s\\'usual sense\\' - and this is the sense that I think you are using it.I would like a clarification upon what you mean by \"the existence ofGod\". We also might differ upon what it means to have faith. Here is whatWebster says:faith 1a: allegiance to duty or a person: LOYALTYb  (1): fidelity to one\\'s promises   (2): sincerity of intentions2a (1): belief and trust in and loyalty to God   (2): belief in the traditional doctrines of a religionb  (1): firm belief in something for which there is no proof        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   (2): complete trust3: something that is believed esp. with strong conviction; esp: a system    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^of religious beliefssyn see BELIEFOne can never prove that God does or does not exist. When you saythat you believe God does not exist, and that this is an opinion\"based upon observation\", I will have to ask \"what observtions areyou refering to?\" There are NO observations - pro or con - thatare valid here in establishing a POSITIVE belief. All observationscan only point you in a direction - a direction that we might evenbe predisposed to (by predisposed I mean, for example, people whoes partents \"believe in God\" also tend to). To actually draw a conclusionabout the \"existence\" or \"non-existence\" of God requires a leap - andyou have made this leap when you actively say \"I believe that God  does/does not exist\". Personally, I think that both statements aremisguided. Arguing over the \"existence\" of God is precisely the wrong wayto find Him (and yes, I use \"Him\" because a personal God is the only viable concept (IMO) - if a person wants to use \"She\" go ahead. Of course God is neither He nor She - but we have no choice but to anthropomorphise. If you want me to explain myself further I\\'ll be glad to.) And please, if someone does not agree with me - even if they violently disagree - it\\'s in no ones advantage to start name calling. If a person thinks I\\'ve misunderstood something in the FAQs, or if they they think I have not read them well enough, just point out to me the error of my ways and I correct the situation.

I do hate liars or the six letter variety of same.The official side has its advocates already; lets balance theequation and asj a few questions on the other side, for the sakeof an old saw the BATF abd FBI seem to want to bypass:innocent until proven guilty.notinnocent until presumed guilty.1)  Where are the video tapes from the tanks?  ALL of them.Don\\'t tell me they do not exist.  They are standardequipment.2)  So you think Koresh fired the place, because of the explosion?a)  Tear gas comes with an aerosol to spread it.  This  aerosol is DELIBERATELY made to be as non-flammable  as possible.  It is as non-flammable as possible..... gotcha!  ... when in isolation from other substances.  WHy was a pipe deliveryu system used rather than remote  launchers?  WHy did the FBI not announce \"this window,  blown in plus tear gas, five minutes; then the wall come  down\", and maintain a left to right sequence?b)  Most aerosols also have a secondary compound, that when  mixed in, becomes a VERY flammable (and difficult to trace)  suspension, with a VERY special property:  exposure to  brief eruptions of high heat (muzzle blasts) or long  exposure to low heat (matches, a stove) will NOT tend  to ignite.What other chemicals come up in the forensics?Who else will be allowed to test the site?c)  After a few minutes to hours (ifdesired, the combnation  rate can be controlled as desired), the mixture can be made  to become veryignitable onb exposure to a temperature  above a certain point (a tracer round) for a certain  heat quantity (a small explosive charge) or for a length  of time (start a wall fire and wait).Check your military records; look at the tapes.Why were tanks (large capacity delivey systems),tear gas (why not somnorifics?), and now (whythe hurry. was there still a comm channel opento the outside?).Do you see any trace of fire coming BACK to thecompound in the videos?  ALL the videos?  Which onesare missing?Do I sound paranoid?  Maybe.  Am I? Probably not.You trust the FBI and BATF  to render judgement?IN advance of a Court?  God help us.(For we are surely not helping ourselves).You trut the Federal Gevernment to give us a clean slate?You are 4.3 trillion (admitted!) down and counting.Look again.Did it happen that way?  I do not know.  I was not there.AND IT SHOULD WAIT FOR A COURT TO DECIDE.But will that happen?  89 people will NOT have the chanceto tell their side as the BATF leader was, on camera.No one wins.

Most of the Flames neglectedto show up, especially in their own zone, as the Kings hit at leastfive posts! The Flames best line was probablySkrudland-Paslawski-Berube (which tells how bad the Flames were). GarySuter scored a great goal (in fact all three Flame goals were scoredby D-men - Yawney and Dahlquist getting the others), but also madesome bonehead plays. For the Kings, Pat Conacher was especiallyimpressive. The games was VERY chippy, as Dan Mirouelli lost control early andnever recovered it; there were high-sticks, cross-checks, punches,hits from behind. Fleury got a game misconduct for rubbing out WarrenRychel from behind. Flames dominated the game physically, but failedto take advantage due to horrendous defensive lapses (I don't thinkVernon can be blamed for any of the goals). Calgary went with 7 D-men,as Roger Johansson played LW; he looked lost IMHO - I hope Kinginserts Chris Lindbergh, Paul Kruse, or Sergei Makarov for Wednesday'sgame. Gretzky left the game in the 2nd period with a charley-horse; noidea how serious - he didn't return.I still think the Flames should win this series, but they betterbuckle down.- Vlad the Impaler\",\n",

Holland had no anti-cracking legislation, and so it was viewedas a \"hacker haven\" by some US system administrators.Similarly, a company called Red Hot Television is broadcasting pornographicmaterial which can be received in Britain.  If they were broadcasting inBritain, they would be committing a crime.  But they are not, they arebroadcasting from Denmark, so the British Government is powerless to doanything about it, in spite of the apparent law-breaking.Of course, I\\'m not a lawyer, so I could be wrong.

(Pro Israeli activists repeat it like parrots without checking its authenticity   since it was coined by Bnai Brith)   What Hamas and Islamic Jihad believe in, as far as I can get from the Arab media,   is an Islamic state that protects the rights of all its inhabitants under Koranic   Law. This would be a reversal of the 1948 situation in which the Jews in   Palestine took control of the land and its (mostly Muslim) inhabitants.   However, whoever committed crimes against humanity (torture, blowing up their   homes, murders,...) must be treated and tried as a war criminal. The political   thought of these movements shows that a freedom of choice will be given to the   Jews in living under the new law or leaving to the destintion of their choice.   As for the PLO, I am at a loss to explain what is going inside Arafat\\'s mind.   Although their political thinking seems far fetched with Israel acting as a true   super-power in the region, the Islamic movements are using the same weapon the   Jews used to establish their state : Religion.   Ahmed.Forget the syntax, Ahmed, and focus on the semnatics. The fact is thatthe PLO does not recognize Israel\\'s right to exist. This is perfectlyobvious from the PLO covenant (Cairo, 1968). The covenant calls forthe destruction of the \"Zionist entity\". As far as I know theIsrael-destruction clauses still exist in the document which specifiesthe purpose for the existence of the PLO. If you would like, I canpost the relevant caluses.Now the Hamas ideal is far more radical, it seems. I know it has beenposted here several times, and while I do not have a copy of it, I amsure that someone does and he (or she, of course) would be more thanhappy to repost it.Regardless of phrasing, groups like Hamas, and the Hezbollah, andeven the newly moderate and politically-correct PLO, have at the veryheart of their ideologies the need for the destrcution of Israel.It just seems to me that Mr. Davidsson\\'s suggestion that Jews supportpeople envolved in these organizations is not a particularly appealingone to many Jews.Harry.',\n",

We know that early Christianssuffered totures because of their witness to Christ.  For example:ACT 5:40    His speech persuaded them. They called the apostles in and had            them flogged. Then they ordered them not to speak in the name of            Jesus, and let them go.ACT 5:41    The apostles left the Sanhedrin, rejoicing because they had been            counted worthy of suffering disgrace for the Name.It appears that the Jewish rulers of that time had a particular aversionto even hearing Jesus\\'s name.ACT 5:28    \"We gave you strict orders not to teach in this name,\" he said.            \"Yet you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and are            determined to make us guilty of this man\\'s blood.\"Finally, the first apostle\\'s death, James of Zebedee was certainlynot by Rome\\'s hand any more than the first martyr Stephen. >The idea of resurrection is one which can be found in a host of different>forms in the religions of antiquity.  The problem was not the resurrection>which was a mediorce issue for a tiny fragment of the Jewish population The problem was that if one believed in the Resurrection, then onemust believe in Jesus as truly being the Son of God and what Hestood for and preached during His ministry on Earth.

About five years ago my mother was diagnosed with having cancer in the lymph nodes under one of her arms. After the doctors removed the cancerous area she had full movement of her arm with only slight aching under her arm when she moved it. Over the course of the next two years the aching got more severe and her complaining to the doctors produced the explanation that it was scar tissue causing the pain. At this time her doctor  suggested that some physiotherapy should be employed to break up the scar tissue. While attending one of her therapy sessions, while her arm was being  manipulated, some damage occured (nerve?) which caused the level of pain to permanently increase severly (controlled by Tylenol 3s) and some loss of use of the arm ( palsied wrist and almost no outward lateral movement). With great persistence on her part the doctors looked further into the issue and discovered that not all of the cancer had been removed and another tumor had grown under the arm. This was removed also but the pain in the arm has not decreased. The doctors are not sure exactly why the pain is  persisting but feel some sort of nerve damage has occured and they have employed Tylenol 3 and soon Morphine to relieve the pain. She has tried acupuncture by this only provides minor reductions in pain and is only short term.   My questions are:      Has anyone has heard of similar cases and what, if anything, was done to reduce the     levels of pain?     Are their methods to block nerves so that the pain can be reduced?     Are their methods to restore nerves so that loss of arm function can be restored?  Any general suggestions on pain reduction would be greatly appreciated.      Please respond by email because I do not always get chance to read this group.  If anyone knows of some literature that may be useful to this case or another newsgroup  that I should be posting this to it would also be appreciated.        -- Gregory W.

It is extremely easy to use, make reports, etc.  Iown both it and Paradox, and I almost never use Paradox.  If you need to build up a complicated application, then Paradox is the way to go.  I haveheard horror stories about the Access programming being extremely cryptic.Since you seem like you will probably be doing fairly small stuff (work/home use and you have not used a database before), I recommend Approach.  I have found only one small thing which I would like it to do more easily:I have one database where the order in which the records are entered must be different than what is the logical ordering.  To permanently reorder (to use the old DBASE III command) the records requires sorting the records appropriately (no problem, since I almost always use them in this order)exporting the database to another database (which can still be an Approach database), and then copying the exported files back to the original filename.  This is a small weakness, considering the other items I really like about Approach.  It is also a little slower than Paradox (other than the loading, Paradox takes forever and a minute to load).  Paradox also takes a lot of memory (both hard disk (around 12MB) and RAM).Greg Bishop. (bishop@baeyer.chem.fsu.edu)',\n",

Our  three year old daughter suffers from this disease.  Below is a press release  that appeared in local newspapers.  Hope you can join us.On Saturday, April 24 as part of Communiversity in Princeton, a local family  will be having a bake and craft sale to raise money for and create public  awareness about a rare disease called Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis.Bill and Marlene Stern's daughter Lindsay is afflicted with this disease  characterized by tumors attacking the inside of the larynx, vocal cords and  trachea.  Caused by a virus, the tumors grow, block the air passages and would  lead to death from suffocation without continual surgery to remove the growths.   Three year old Lindsay has undergone 11 operations thus far since her diagnosis  last year and faces the prospect of over a hundred operations throughout her  lifetime.  Even though the disease is hardly a household word, it has affected the lives  of enough people to inspire the formation of the Recurrent Respiratory  Papillomatosis Foundation,  a non-profit foundation whose goals are to provide  support for patients and families by networking patients and publishing a  newsletter, enhance  awareness of RRP at the local and national level, and aid  in the prevention, cure, and treatment.Since medical researchers know that the virus causing the disease is similar to  those viruses causing warts, they feel a cure would be within reach if money  were available for research.  Because RRP is rare, it not only gets scant  attention but also paltry funds to search for a cure.  Part of the RRP  Foundation's mission is to change that. Anyone interested in contributing items to the bake and craft sale, please call  Marlene or Bill at 609-890-0502.  Monetary donations can be made at the  Foundation's booth during Communiversity, April 24th, 12 to 4 p.m., in downtown  Princeton, or sent directly to:The Recurrent Respiratory Foundation                50 Wesleyan Drive                Hamilton Sq., NJ  08690.Thanks   mstern@lindsay.princeton.edu\",\n",

But do you really believe that this is the reason ?|> Could you provide evidence that this is the case and that it|> serves no other purpose ?A number of points.  You are making assumptions about the mannerin which the cards are used.  True, by law, all residents, citizens,and tourists must carry a form of identification with them.  Forcitizens, the standard ID is the ID card.  The purpose this serveson a daily basis, wherein they are presented at public places,is for the purpose of identifying the bearer.  This takes placein banks (cashing checks), post offices (registered mail and such), etc...Quite frankly, it was rare that I ever had to present my ID cardfor such activities more than once per week.  There is no law orrequirement that forces people to wave their ID cards in public.Furthermore, none of the services I outlined discriminate againstthe bearer in any manner by having access to this information.The only case that I can think of in which the Le\\'um field mightbe taken into account is during interaction with the police,based upon the scenario.  In general though, arab citizens areclearly recognizable, as are non-arabs. Your argument thereforebecomes moot unless you can provide an example of how this fieldis being used to discriminate against them officially.|> In the answer to my second questions, concerning the fact that|> Israel has no fixed borders, you state that Israel\\'s borders were|> \\'shaped and reshaped by both war and peace\\'. According to what I|> read, the first Zionists in the beginning of the Century, had|> plans for the Jewish State to extend into what is Lebanon and into|> Transjordan (Jordan).

Israel often claims it right of existence on the|> fact that Jews lived there 2000 years ago or that God promised the|> land to them.

Having all the above facts in mind, one|> cannot blame Arab countries to fear Israeli expansionism, as a|> number of wars have proved (1948, 1956, 1967, 1982).I take issue with your assertions.  I think that Arab countriesdo know that they have nothing to fear from \"Israeli expansionism\".Militarily, Israel is not capable of holding onto large tracts ofland under occupation to a hostile, armed, and insurgent population for asustained period of time.  As is, the intifada is heavily taxingthe Israeli economy.  Proof of this can be seen in the Israeliwithdrawal from Lebanon.  Israeli troops pulled back from theAwali, and later from the Litani, in order to control the minimalstrip needed to keep towns out of range of Katyusha missile fire.Public opinion in Israel has turned towards settling the intifadavia territorial concessions.  The Israel public is sufferring frombattle fatigue of sorts and the gov\\'t is aware of it.With regards to borders, let me state the following.  I may not agreewith the manner in which negotiations are being held, however the cruxof the matter is that everyone either makes or refrains from statinga starting position.  The arab parties have called for total withdrawaland a return to pre-48 borders.  If Israel were to state large borders,the negotiations might never get under way.  If Israel were to statesmaller borders, then the arab countries might try and force even smallerborders during the negotiations.  I think that leaving the matter to besettled by negotiations and peace treaties is infinitely more realisticand sensible.|> Your answer to my third question is typical of a Stalinist public|> official. I don\\'t think your answer is honest.  You refer me to|> Vanunu\\'s revelations about Israel\\'s nuclear arsenal without|> evaluating the truthfullness of his revelations. Now if he said|> the truth, then why should he been punished, and if he lied, why|> should he be punished?

You may take issuewith a number of things but clearly you have no understanding of theconcept of \"Secrets of state\", something which every democratic govthas.|> Somebody provided an answer to the fourth question, concerning|> \\'hidden prisoners\\' in Israeli prisons.

My own feelings are that the matter of the arrest should bemade public unless a court order is issued allowing a delay of X hours.This would be granted only if a judge could be convinced that anannouncement would cause irreparable harm to the ongoing investigation.|> You imply that my questions show bias and are formulated in such a|> way to \\'cast aspersions upon Israel\\'.

They have been involved in quite a#>lot of illegal activity - including multiple (and often underage) wives#>for the leaders - a practice still in vogue with some splinters of their#>sect.  The parallels between Koresh and Joseph Smith are striking.#                                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^By \"they,\" you mean the leaders of the lds church?  I grant you that whenJoseph Smith was still alive, plenty of \"accusations\" were filed, most ofwhich had little bearing with reality, as evidenced by various verdicts.I have studied lds history for 15 years now, and I have yet to see provethat the lds leadership was involved, in quote: \"illegal activities.\"Plural marriage, yes, but your charge of \"underage\" wives sounds like itcould have originated from a tabloid, and discredits the high moralstandards which characterized these leaders and families, unlike, as itappears, those of David Koresh.#        Joseph Smith started the sect.  After he and his brother Hyram#were murdered in a Nauvoo, Il. jail cell, church membership split over#who to follow.  Initially, Smith was considered a prophet (just like#Mohammed, a rather interesting parallel considering Muslims consider#Christ to be a prophet the same as Jews, I\\'m led to understand.  Make#no mistake, this was no messiah we\\'re talking about in Smith).  TheAnd neither did he claim he was.  As the church reflects the moralaptitude of its leaders (and especially those of Joseph Smith), I havenothing but the highest respect for this inspired man, whose only \"crime\"was that he refused to deny that he had seen a vision...  Many have triedto explain the \"Smith phenomenon\" away, but the bold presence of an 8.5million member strong church stands as a witness that Joseph Smith\\'stestimony had enough resilience and power to carry on the message.#thought at the time was that the gift of prophecy was to be handed#down father to son.  After Joseph Smith died, his son was only#entering his teens.  Brigham Young and a few others claimed to have#been bequeathed the gift and leadership prior to his death.  The#Council of Twelve, the Church governing body, wasn\\'t of much help#here, and this basic conflict is still a wedge between the sects.#Brigham Young took his followers to Salt Lake.  The rest waited#for Smith Jr. to grow up enough to assume leadership.  The other#claimants to the leadership were soon ignored, like Mike Dukakis. ;-)\"The rest\" were apostates and excommunicated members of the Church,while the great majority of the membership, the Twelve, and the variousauxiliary organizations, chose to accept Brigham Young as the newprophet and leader of the Church.  If you knew your lds scriptures anddoctrine, you would have known that Brigham Young was the FIRST inline to fill the prophet Joseph Smith\\'s vacancy: he was the seniorapostle in the Quorum, and various comments made by Joseph indicatedthat it was Brigham who would lead the latter-day exodus to the West.Other rightful \"heirs\" were either dead (Hyrum Smith) or excommunicated(Oliver Cowdery), and while persecutions abounded and intensified,Joseph Smith had already given orders to look for a new place, an emptyland beyond the boundaries of the United States (at that time).  This\"Rekhabite\" principle (pseudographia) was well understood and antipatedby the great majority of lds faithful, and was not questioned by them.Granted, a couple of \"do-it-yourselfers\" stayed behind, unwilling tosacrifice and to undertake the perilous journey to the unknown, butthis also was necessary to separate the tares from the wheat.  Thechurch benefitted from this purification process: they became evenmore unified and willing to carry out their mission to the world.#        Both sects practiced the \"1-year food stockpile\" doctrine,#and this being frontier and farming country most carried or at#least owned weapons.  There is little evidence that they were a#militaristic sect, given that they tended to move on rather than#face large-scale opposition.  Brigham Young, having suffered a#great deal getting to Salt Lake, seems to have been quite#justified in making military training a good thing.  Remember,#this was far beyond where even the US Army went, and these people#had nobody to turn to save themselves.##        Just a little context to put this all in perspective.BTW, since when is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (one ofthe largest denominations in the country) a \"sect\"???  It didn\\'t \"splinter\"from any other religion, as did say, the Southern Baptists or Methodists.#>So what did the Mormons get?  It seems that J.

I amnot comfortable with this alleged \"cosiness\" with Mammon: I assure youthat *many* among us reject this attitude categorically.  Period.  OurONLY true allegiance is to our God and to the leaders which He hasappointed to represent Him.

Though J. Edgar is finally gone, the FBI#>personnel (especially the field agents) are still heavily Mormon.#>I have often wondered how this might affect the FBI\\'s treatment#>of religious organizations a Mormon would consider heretical.Preposterous.  Even if this were true (reliable data, please), Iam convinced that those officers would perform to the highest codesof honor and conduct (that\\'s why they were selected for in thefirst place, remember?).  Besides, one of our Articles of FaithSTRONGLY states the principle of freedom of religion, and that allpeople are free to worship \"*how*, *where*, or *what* they may.\"#        If it\\'s true, there would be little affect.  LDS and RLDS#philosophy is that all other religions have strayed from the true#Church as set down by Jesus, but that God will judge each on his#own merits.  In addition, the RLDS also contend (and the LDS may#as well) that ignorance of the True Way (tm) is an excuse.  You#can only be condemned if you had been tought the way and rejected#it.  In short, LDS and RLDS suffer everybody from Lutherans to#Buddhists, secure in the knowledge that though they are wrong they#will not be penalized for ignorance.  It is more likely that Hoover#liked them because of their rather strict upbringings which forbade#alcohol, tobacco, hot drink (like coffee or tea), and the like.#These people are the \"salt of the Earth\" and as such are more#easily made to follow orders and have few vices to be used against them.A good explanation, I can accept that.  You are right that lds peopleare sometimes a little too cosy with Mammon\\'s \"orders\" (the latepresident Kimball, for example, was an exception with his strongopposition of the selection of the MX \"Peace Keeper\" missile mazein Utah).#        That\\'s my somewhat educated guess, anyway.

Who is the clay to talk back to the potter? But we find acontrary view in Scripture. When God proposes to destroy the city ofSodom (Genesis 18), Abraham says: + Suppose that there are some good men in the city. + Will you destroy the righteous along with the wicked? + Far be it from you, Lord, to do such a thing! + Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?I am told that the Hebrew is actually a bit stronger than this, andcan perhaps be better rendered (dynamic equivalence) as + Shame on you, Lord, if you do such a thing!There are those who say that the definition of \"good\" is \"whateverGod happens to want.\" But if that is so, then the statement that Godis good has no meaning.  It simply says that God does what He wants.That being the case, no one can either love or obey God because Heis good. The only motive left for obeying Him is that He ispowerful. Just as it makes sense to obey a dictator, even when hetells you to round up all Jews and exterminate them, because if youdefy him you might end up in the gas chamber yourself, so it makessense to obey God, because He has the power to punish you if youdon\\'t. This ethical theory I take to be in radical contradiction toGenesis 18 and to Christianity in general.Any theory that makes our moral judgements worthless makes anyfurther discussion of morality (or of the goodness of God)meaningless. However, it does not follow that our moral judgementsare always infallible in particular cases, still less our judgementsin particular cases about the course of action most likely toachieve a good result.When I read the Scriptural accounts of the actions of God inhistory, those actions often seem to me very different from what Imight expect of a God who loves us and desires what is best for us.Moreover, leaving the Scriptures aside, and considering the naturalworld, I find that Nature is often very different from what I mightexpect if it were the work of a benevolent deity.  (Origen said:\"Those who believe that the Author of Nature is also the Author ofthe Scriptures must expect to find in the Scriptures the same sortof difficulties that they find in Nature.\")Now, that some such difficulties should exist is not in itself anargument against the existence, power, wisdom, and goodness of God.On the contrary, their ABSENCE would be such an argument. Supposethat I am watching Bobby Fisher play chess, and suppose that everytime he makes a move, I find myself nodding and saying: \"Good move!Just what I was expecting him to do.  Same move I would have made ifI were playing.\" That would be a sign that Fisher is no better achess player than myself. Given that he is better, I expect that atleast some of his moves will have me thinking, \"Now, what do supposeinduced him to do that?\" or even, \"Boy, that was a real slip -- he\\'sjust thrown the game away!\" Similarly, if God understands theworkings of the universe better than I do, it is to be expected thatsometimes it will look to me as if He has made a mistake.One difference between Fisher at the chessboard and God at thecontrols of the universe is that I can see the end of the chessgame. If Fisher wins, I revise my earlier inference that it wascarelessness that made him lose his queen 23 moves earlier.However, if he loses, and particularly if I can see that there was atime when he had an opportunity for a checkmate in two moves and didnot take it, then I know that he is not as good a player as I hadthought.With God, on the other hand, I shall not in this life see the totalresult of some of His actions. Therefore, my grounds for judgingthat I have seen a bad move on His part must always be far shakierthan my grounds for making a similar judgement about Fisher.     *****     *****     *****     *****     *****In the book of Genesis, we read that Joseph\\'s ten older brothers,who (with good reason) found  him insufferable, conspired to sellhim into slavery in Egypt. There he eventually became Viceroy, andwhen there was a famine in Canaan, he was able to provide for hisfamily. When his brothers nervously apologized, he told them: \"Donot worry. You meant to do me evil, but God turned it into good.\"I once heard a rabbi speak on this text. He said:        The history of the Jews is largely a history of events   that look like catastrophes that threaten the continued   survival of the religion, or the people, or both. But,   amazingly, those events turn out to be the saving of the Jews   and of Judaism.        The sale of Joseph by his brothers looked like the breakup   of the family.  But in fact, it ended with a reconciliation of   the quarrel between them. The famine that drove the family out   of Canaan looked like a misfortune for them.  But in fact, if   they had stayed in Canaan, they would almost certainly have   intermarried with the Canaanites and been assimilated into   their culture.  Their oppression by the Egyptians a few   generations after their arrival in Egypt again looked like a   disaster. But God used it to bring them out of Egypt, and into   the Promised Land.        Here the people built a Temple, and regularly offered   sacrifices. But the Babylonians captured Jerusalem and Judea,   destroyed Temple and city and countryside, and deported most of   the people to Babylon. You might have thought that that would   be the end of the people and the religion. But it was not.   Living in Canaan, the people had been under constant danger of   assimilation.  Again and again, they had turned from the   worship of the LORD to the worship of the Canaanite fertility   cults, with their ritual prostitution and ritual human   sacrifice. The Babylonian captivity put a stop to that. Never   again did the Jews show any interest in polytheism or idolatry.   Neither the worship of the Canaanites mor that of the   Babylonians ever again had a foothold among them.        Nor is that all. Judaism had been in danger of becoming   simply a system of sacrifices and Temple observances. The only   prescribed acts of worship consisted of coming to Jerusalem   every so often and offering a sacrifice. During the Captivity,   with the Temple gone, the Jews invented the synagogue, a place   of meeting for reading and study and discussion of the   Scriptures. They came to realize clearly, what they were in   danger of forgetting while they continued to live in Judea,   that God is not simply a local or tribal deity, not just the   controller of the land of Canaan, or the patron of the Jewish   people, but the Creator of the world, and the Ruler and Judge   of all humans everywhere.        Time passed, and the Babylonian Empire was replaced by   that of the Persians, and then that of the Greeks, or rather   the Macedonians. The ruler, Antiochus Epiphanes, was determined   to stamp out Judaism, and to this end he made the reading and   the study of the Torah punishable by death. Again, one might   think that this would be the end of Judaism. But it was not.   The people met for worship, and instead of reading the Torah   portion appointed for the day, they would read some passage   from the prophets that had a similar theme, and then discuss   that.  Before this time, the Torah, the so-called Five Books of   Moses (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy)   were the only books read and studied in the synagogue.  If it   had not been for Antiochus, the books of the prophets would   probably have been forgotten altogether. His hatred for Judaism   saved them.        [Other examples here omitted for brevity\\'s sake.]        Some of you may remember that Julie Andrews first became   famous as Eliza Doolittle in the stage production of MY FAIR   LADY. When Warner Brothers undertook to make a movie of it,   everyone expected that Julie, who had been so magnificent on   stage, would play the same role in the movie. Instead, the   studio decided to go with an established screen star, and cast   Audrey Hepburn.  Julie Andrews was naturally crushed. But she   later realized that if she had played the screen role, she   would have been type-cast for life as an Elize Doolittle type.   It would have been a disaster for her. As it was, Walt Disney   offered her the role of Mary Poppins, and she won an Oscar for   it.  At the presentation, she stood there, smiling, and looking   at Walt Disney, she said, \"And now, my special thanks to the   man who made all this possible -- JACK WARNER!\" It was the most   memorable line of the evening.        In a similar spirit, we Jews might thank the men who in   the providence of God have preserved Judaism, and kept it alive   to this day, beginning with Joseph\\'s brothers, and continuing   with two Pharaohs, with Nebuchadnezzar, with Antiochus   Epiphanes....After the formal meeting had broken up, one woman came up to himprivately and said, \"You were talking about the Holocaust, weren\\'tyou?\" He answered, \"If that is an example that came to your mind,then you are right, I was talking about it to you. But I would nottalk about it to everyone, for not everyone can bear it.\" I assumethat he meant that, without the Holocaust, there would have been nostate of Israel.Someone hearing the rabbi\\'s lecture might leap to the conclusionthat God is dependent on the wickedness of men to accomplish Hispurposes -- or at least that the rabbi thought so. He might then  goon to suppose that the wickedness is in fact God\\'s doing -- that Hestirred up Joseph\\'s brothers to a murderous hate against him, andthat when the Israelites were in Egypt, God hardened Pharaoh\\'sheart, so that he oppressed the people, and would not let them go.And this raises questions about how an action can be consideredwicked and at the same time be considered something that God hasbrought about.I suggest another way of looking at it. Consider a sculptor who hasa log of wood from which he proposes to carve a statue. But the log,instead of having a smooth even grain throughout, has a large knotthat spoils the appearance of the surface. The sculptor considersthe wood for a while, and then carves a statue that features theknot, that makes that particular interruption in the grain and colorof the wood correspond to some feature of the statue, so thatobservers will say: \"How fortunate the sculptor was in finding apiece of wood with a knot like that in just the right place. Itspresence is the crowning touch, the thing that makes the statue agreat work of art.\" In reality, the knot, far from being what the sculptor waslooking for, was a challenge to his skill. If the wood had notcontained that flaw, he would still have made a great work of art,but a different one. So, if Joseph\\'s brothers had not sold him, Godwould still have brought about His purposes for the Jewish people,but He would have done so in another manner. If Judas had notbetrayed Jesus, if Caiaphas and his fellow leaders had not rejectedJesus, but had rather acknowledged Him as the Annointed of God, ifPilate had followed his conscience rather than his fears and had setJesus free, it might appear that there would have been noCrucifixion, and therefore no Redemption, and therefore noSalvation. Not so. God did not need Judas\\' sin to redeem us. IfJudas had done right, then God in Christ would still have reconciledthe world to Himself.  We do not know how, just as we do not knowhow Michelangelo would have painted the Sistine Chapel if itsinterior had instead been shaped like Grand Central Station, andjust as we do not know how Bobby Fisher would have won his fourthgame agianst Spassky if Spassky had refused the exchange of bishopsand had attacked Fisher\\'s knight instead (don\\'t bother to look upthe game in question--I am making up this example, but the point isnone the less valid).Thus, we may say both (1) that God used, say, the cowardice ofPilate to accomplish His purposes, and (2) that the said cowardicewas not God\\'s doing, and that Pilate would not have thwarted God\\'splans by behaving justly and courageously.What, then, are we to make of the place where God says to Moses, \"Iwill harden Pharaoh\\'s heart, so that he will not let the people go\"?Some Christians have taken this to mean that Pharaoh was a puppetwith God pulling the strings, and that his stubbornness and crueltywere not his own work, but the work of God in him. I suppose ratherthat what God was telling Moses was something like this: \"If you seethat Pharaoh is not willing to let the people go, do not bediscouraged, or suppose that the situation is out of my control. Mypurposes will not be thwarted. If Pharaoh chooses to hear you andlet the people go, well and good. If he does not, I will fit hisresistance into my plans, and fit it so perfectly that futurehistorians and theologians will suppose that I would have beenthrown for a loss if Pharaoh had obeyed me.\"To return to the question that started this all off. Is it possiblethat the Serbs, in slaughtering the Moslems of Bosnia, areinstruments of God\\'s will?     First point. What they are doing is wrong, just as whatJoseph\\'s brothers did was wrong, just as what Judas did was wrong.They intend it for evil. If God somehow brings good out of it, thatdoes not make them any less subject to just condemnation andpunishment.     Second point. Of course, God will bring good out of it. But notthe same good that He would have brought if the Serbians hadrefrained from the sins of robbery and rape and murder. Nor does thegood He purposes excuse us from the duty of doing what is right.

I tried to get into being as christian as I could, as I felt I 'should'.But the more I tried, the more depressed I got. I felt guilty for some of myown personal, honest feelings. I tried so hard to reconcile this conflict.until I was 23.Then I taught myself to think rationally. I read a lot of books, pro and con religion in general and, specifically, catholicism. I came to a crisis point,then it finally clicked and now I am a staunch atheist. This is a very loose explanation, but it's the gist of it.Now, (at 26) I feel better about myself, better self-esteem, a generally stronger person. I have well-defined goals. I have a strong and stable sense of morals and values. I am not a neo-nazi or a corrupt politicain, etc. I believe in human rights and 'live and let live' among other things. I am very anti-violent and anti-hatred.

I believe all of thepeople mentioned here deserve the hall of fame more than Dave Kingman does. Ifeel they were all much better players. I am not saying I fell they deserve togo but that they would deserve it more. IMHO Dave Kingman - definately not. They guy only had a couple of years were hecould hit with atleast a respectable averag. The rest of his career I do notthink he was very feared by pitchers. I also do not think he did a lot for thegame. I mean really I am a Met fan - he was a Met for part of his career and Istill would not back him for the Hall of Fame.Dave Winfield - I think so. He is feared by pitchers, he has had severalseason where he hit for a respectable average and his production numbers are(in my opinion - without stats) better than Kingman's (probably by quite abit). I also perceive him to be a leader, maybe not as much as some otherpeople but none the less a leader. I think he has made substantialcontributions to the game of baseball and to society. Examples of this aresome of the charitable things he has done (I know some of this from when hewas with the Yankees). I think he the type of player that kids can look up toand while this is definately not the only criteria for the Hall of Fame Ithink it deserves some consideration.Lee Smith - Maybe, I would have to see his stats again but he definately woulddeserve to go before the likes of Kingman.Darrell Evans - No.Eddie Murray - Maybe, He has had a very good career, he is a leader (althougha silent one), he is a good role model. Are the stats good enough? I am notsure - but I would once again believe they are much better than Kingman's boththe average as well as the power numbers (but not as good as Winfield's). Justthink, Eddie did not have as much publicity for most of his great years.Jeff Reardon - My guess is no, but it kind of depends on his numbers. Off thetop of my head I would take Lee Smith first.|> |>      Well, in any case, I am sick and tired (mostly sick) of everybody|> giving|> |> Hall of Fame consideration to players that are by today's standards,|> marginal.|> |> Honestly, Ozzie Smith and Robin Yount don't belong there. They're both|> |> shortstops that just hung around for a long time. Big deal.|> Well, I strongly disagree here. Both of these guys deserve it for sure. Italked about leadership above, both of these guys are leaders and have beeninstumental in leading their teams to the post season. Robin does have verygood offensive numbers both average and power and Ozzie has okay numbersoffensively. The difference with Ozzie is that if you gave him a home run forevery run he saved by making an incredible play at shortstop - he would haveshattered Aaron's home run mark by now. How many of those great plays savedgames? How many of those great plays motivated his team to rally and win agame? While I believe both of these guys have numbers, baseball is about morethan numbers (or at least winning at baseball is about more than numbers).Both of these guys are proven stars and belong in the Hall of Fame. As doesGeorge Brett who also belongs in this class of player.|>      Let's be a little more selective, huh? Stop handing out these honors|> so|> |> liberally.

When|> |> certain individuals believe that Steve Garvey or Jack Morris are potential|> |> candidates, the absurdity is apparent. Gee, can these guys even compare to|> |> the more likely future Hall of Famers like Kirby Puckett or Nolan Ryan?|> Steve Garvey - I am not sure, probably not but I guess I could see someonemaking a case for him. Jack Morris - Once again not my first choice but I can see why someone mightbring up his name.Kirby Puckett - Probably. The only reason I do not say definately is he stillhas time left in his career. If he continues doing what he has been then myprobably will turn into a definately.Nolan Ryan - Is there really any doubt? I think I heard something about himhaving some 53 records (maybe they were not all good - I don't know I did nothear any of them just the number).

I have been studying the problem of font conversion for a few years buthave never had the need to implement such a system. Well, I now have theopportunity to write some font rendering software so I would like to havesome of my questions answered before I jump into the deep end.The main problem I face is how to use the even/odd or non-winding rules toturn the outlines into a single outline polygon (my renderer can handlecomplex polygons so there is no need to reduce the polygons to simplepolygons). For example, in the letter \"O\" there are two outlines:1) The outside outline which is clockwise (TrueType font)2) The inside outline which is counterclockwise.One common solution used by a number of rendering packages is to simply connect the inner outline to the outer outline at the point where thetwo outlines are closest. This is equivalent to descibing a \"polygon withholes\". The renderer will then make the appropriate hole since the interiorpolygon edges are in the opposite direction to the outside edges.I do not want to use this simplistic system since:1) It will not handle all outline fonts properly (it is not a simplematter to connect the outer outline to the inner outline forsome fancy fonts).2) It does not properly handle the even/odd or non-winding rules.From my research over the years the proper solution is to use a trapezoiddecomposition algorithm to scan convert the outlines into trapezoids (asis done by the Postscript and TrueType font rasterizers). These trapezoidalpolygons can then be easily and properly rendered by the 3D scanline renderer.My question is: are there any better solutions to turning the outlines intopolgyons other than the trapezoid decomposer? I am not fond of this solutionsince it creates excess number of polygons.Another question, for those in the know: what is the best algorithm to createbevelled and/or offset curves for font outlines? I have a dozen papers on thesesubjects but I can\\'t tell which method is the best to implement.Thanks for any pointers.--> Rob Lansdale-- Robert Lansdale - (416) 978-6619       Dynamic Graphics ProjectInternet: lansd@dgp.toronto.edu        Computer Systems Research InstituteUUCP:   ..!uunet!dgp.toronto.edu!lansd University of TorontoBitnet:  lansd@dgp.utoronto           Toronto, Ontario M5S 1A4, CANADA',\n",

We\\'re not going to fall over.  (Many  first-time riders are surprised by how tightly you can turn!)- Turn dynamics:  sit so that you feel like you\\'re sitting upright and  we\\'re going straight.  Trust your butt, not your eyes -- if you\\'re  confused, close your eyes for a couple of turns to get the feel  of it.  Or just hug me tight.  - Please, no sudden moves -- shift your weight as desired, but be   gradual, so I can compensate.- Your faceplate is yours to open/close as desired.- Trust is essential.  Trust the driver (me) to do the right   thing -- I\\'ve driven many miles on this thing, and know how  to operate it.  Enjoy the ride.  (This is important to  stress.  For example, one of my first-time passwngers seemed to   watch the speedo like a hawk:  I drove her to the beach down 84,   and whever we topped 35 mph, she\\'d holler, \"SLOW DOWN! I\\'M SCARED\"   I humored her for a while, then simply covered the speedometer with   the spare piece of duct tape I keep stuck to the top of the cluster.  Problem solved:  she watched the scenery instead of the  instruments, and had a much better time.  Based on her  experience driving a Lincoln Continental, she was unwilling to   trust my ability to choose a safe speed for the bike.)Usually I\\'ll point out the controls, engine, transmission, brakes, tires, etc. and discuss motorcycle physics a bit too for first-timers.Helps calm their nerves, and gives the bike a chance to warm up.Watch out for gravel on the Mt.

I just reposted avery good one, under the title \"Islam and Women\", reposted fromsoc.religion.islam.  If this has already disappeared from your site,then please email me telling me so and I will email you a copy of thisexcellent article.  IMHO, your understanding of the issue of women in Islam is sadly deficient.Regarding slaves, _my_ posting on slavery -- the second one I made,which is a repost of an article I wrote early last year -- is basedcompletely on the Qur\\'an and contains numerous Qur\\'anic verses andhadiths to support its point of view.Our approaches are different -- you are arguing from a historicalstandpoint and I am arguing directly from the teachings of the Qur\\'anand hadiths.  Now, just because people say they are Muslims and performa particular action, does that automatically mean that their action ispart of Islam, even if it is opposed by the Qur\\'an and Sunnah?  No!  Ofcourse not.Let me give you a concrete example, which might help clarify this foryou.  The Qur\\'an prohibits drinking.  Now, if a person says \"I am aMuslim\" and then proceeds to drink a bottle of beer, does this now meanthat Islam teaches that people should drink beer?  Of course not, andonly an idiot would think so.Do you see my point?>It is very natural to think that>the author/authors of the Quran had no idea that the socio-economic>structure they were advocating would experience at least two paradigm>shifts in 1400 years in the western cultures - first with the end of >the feudal era and the rise of commerce, second with the industrial >revolution.

In fact, the rise of Islam can easily be modeled>after the pyramid effect - you do not produce any wealth at home,>but increase your wealth by conquering places.  You are judging Islam here on capitalist terms.  Capitalism is anideology based largely on the assumption that people want to maximisetheir wealth -- this assumption is in opposition to Islamic teachings.To say Islam is bad because it is not capitalist is pretty unthinking --Islam does not pretend to be capitalist and does not try to becapitalist.  (This does not mean that Islam does not support afree-market -- for it does in general -- but there are other parts of capitalism which are opposed to Islam as I understand it.)>When this stopped,>you (and I) were left bare in the open for emperialists to devour.>No capital, no industry, very poor social services - the education>level in Muslim countries are the lowest in the world, the health>statistics are miserable etc.. One can postulate numerous reasons for this.  Your theory is that it isbecause Islam is not secularist and capitalist, etc. etc.Selim, I will give you a clear historical example to show you thefallacy of your views if you think (as you obviously do) thatIslam => lack of education and power.For a large part of history, the Islamic world was very powerful.  For asignificant section of history, the Islamic world was the foremost inthe sciences.  So to say that Islam is, for example, anti-education iscompletely absurd.  You try to blame this situation on Islam -- historyshows that your conclusion is false and that, instead, there must beother reasons for this situation.>You blame Muslims for not following the Quran, but I blame Muslims >for following the Quran. Well, Selim, your viewpoint on women in Islam makes me question the extentof your knowledge of Islam.  I really think you are notknowledgeable enough to be able to judge whether the Muslims arefollowing the Qur\\'an or not.>Your idea is baseless from historical>facts, it is a poor utopia, The Islamic world was at the forefront of the world in science at onestage -- yet somehow, in your theory, it is by \"following the Qur\\'an\"that Muslims are backwards in education.  Selim, it is _your_ thesisthat is anti-historical, for you conveniently overlook this historicalfact which contradicts your theory. >while my ideas are derived from social>and economic history. You have certainly not shown this; you have merely stated it.So far, it seems to me that your view on Islam being anti-education isquite contrary to history.  That you are so convinced of your viewsmakes me wonder just how objectively you are trying to look at all ofthis.>My solution to all Muslims is simple:>CUT THE CRAP, I think, Selim, you should consider taking your own advice.>GET THE FACTS STRAIGHT Here too.>AND WORK HARD TO REVERSE>THE EFFECTS OF 1300 YEARS OF IGNORANCE.Selim, you have such conviction of your viewpoint, yet you demonstrateignorance, not only of Islam but also of Islamic history (particularlywith respect to Muslims being leaders of science till about 1400 or so Ithink).  Yet you say that your viewpoint is based on history!Selim, if I remember right, you say in one of your earlier posts thatyou are an apostate from Islam.

There were NEVER any specific projects included in the CommunityDevelopment Block Grant portion of the President\\'s proposal.  CongressionalRepublicans, in an effort to discredit the stimulus package, selected whatthey felt were silly sounding projects from a wish-list of POTENTIAL projects prepared by the US Mayors\\' Conference before the stimulus packagewas ever proposed.  (The document in question was designed to pressure theWhite House to increase the size of the block grant proposal submittedto Congress.  It didn\\'t work.)The $2.56(?) billion proposed in the stimulus package came nowhere closeto covering the total estimated cost of the original wish-list.  If itwere passed, communities would have to select which projects to fund andat what level.In the case of Spokane, Wa., Tom Foley\\'s home district, no one everexpected to be able to refurbish a local swimming pool (one of the Republicans\\' examples) FROM THE FUNDS AVAILABLE IN THE STIMULUSPACKAGE since the estimated cost of doing so exceeded the total amount of block grant funds the city would receive from the stimulus package for ALL projects.  The plan, instead, was to use the money on public housing constructionand remodeling to cope with a severe housing shortage.  (Yup, there areplaces where that is true.)  The swimming pool improvements were near thebottom of a long list of priorities prepared by the city.  The $3 millionor so to be received would cover only a few of the most pressingpriorities.If the block grants are cut from the stimulus package, it is these projectsthat will be affected by the lack of funds.  And that is why the Clintonadministration has been publicizing the issue.A final point.  One may or may not like community block grants.  It isworth noting, however, that Congressional Republicans\\' opposition to themis new.  Since the Nixon administration, Republicans have generally supported such grants as an alternative to targeted federal spending,arguing that local governments are far better able to determine spendingpriorities than \"Washington bureaucrats.\"  Is it clear now?  Or is this all too complicated to understand?jsh--Steve Hendricks                        |  DOMAIN:  steveh@thor.ISC-BR.COM   \"One thing about data, it sure does cut|  UUCP:    ...!uunet!isc-br!thor!steveh the bulls**t.\" - R.

What I\\'m trying to point out is that, in matters of faith(i.e. tenets which are not logically persuasive), one may be convincedof the truth of certain things through, for instance, personalrevelation.  And its certainly fine to share that revelation or thosebeliefs with others.  And I don\\'t think that its arrogant, persay, toaccepts matters of pure faith as truth for oneself.  Where I think theconflict arises is in assuming that, where disagreements on beliefsarise, all others *must* have been given the same truth, and that God must reveal His truth to everyone in such a way that all would honestly agree.  I think this can lead to the conclusion that anyone who disagrees with you are being sinful or dishonest; that they are rejecting something they *know* to be truth because it is inconvenient for them, or because they wish to spurn God.I would say that this is equivalent to assuming that *all* truths one holds are universal and absolute.  And the problem I see with this is that it negates the individuality of humans and their relationships withGod.  This does not mean there is no absolute truth; just that some areasof doctrinal disagreement may be areas where God has not established or revealed that truth.  -- comments, criticism welcome...-Kenalvin@ucsu.colorado.edu[I agree with you.  --clh]',\n",

The manifest is also available from the Ames SPACE    archive in SPACE/FAQ/manifest. The portion of his manifest formerly    included in this FAQ has been removed; please refer to his posting or    the archived copy. For the most up to date information on upcoming    missions, call (407) 867-INFO (867-4636) at Kennedy Space Center.    Official NASA shuttle status reports are posted to sci.space.news    frequently.    WHY DOES THE SHUTTLE ROLL JUST AFTER LIFTOFF?    The following answer and translation are provided by Ken Jenks    (kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov).    The \"Ascent Guidance and Flight Control Training Manual,\" ASC G&C 2102,    says:\"During the vertical rise phase, the launch pad attitude iscommanded until an I-loaded V(rel) sufficient to assure launch towerclearance is achieved. Then, the tilt maneuver (roll program)orients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate anegative q-alpha, which in turn alleviates structural loading. Otheradvantages with this attitude are performance gain, decreased abortmaneuver complexity, improved S-band look angles, and crew view ofthe horizon. The tilt maneuver is also required to start gainingdownrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff (MECO) targetin second stage.\"    This really is a good answer, but it\\'s couched in NASA jargon. I\\'ll try    to interpret.    1)We wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling.    2)Then, we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attackbetween the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the\"relative wind\") and the chord of the wings (the imaginary linebetween the leading edge and the trailing edge) is a slightlynegative angle (\"a negative q-alpha\").This causes a little bit of\"downward\" force (toward the belly of the Orbiter, or the +Zdirection) and this force \"alleviates structural loading.\"We have to be careful about those wings -- they\\'re about themost \"delicate\" part of the vehicle.    3)The new attitude (after the roll) also allows us to carry moremass to orbit, or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass, orto change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would bethe case if we didn\\'t roll (\"performance gain\").    4)The new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicatedflight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abortmaneuvers, the Return To Launch Site (\"decreased abort maneuvercomplexity\").    5)The new attitude improves the ability for ground-based radioantennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the S-band radioantennae on the Orbiter (\"improved S-band look angles\").    6)The new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon, which is ahelpful (but not mandatory) part of piloting any flying machine.    7)The new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body ismore nearly parallel with the ground, and the nose to the east(usually).  This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocityin the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit.  Remember:velocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction.The Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to itsvelocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit.    This all begs the question, \"Why isn\\'t the launch pad oriented to give    this nice attitude to begin with?  Why does the Shuttle need to roll to    achieve that attitude?\"  The answer is that the pads were leftovers    from the Apollo days.  The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches -- one    for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust, one for the Space Shuttle Main    Engine exhaust.  (You can see the effects of this on any daytime    launch.  The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the SSME exhaust is    fluffy white steam.  Watch for the difference between the \"top\"    [Orbiter side] and the \"bottom\" [External Tank side] of the stack.) The    access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented    basically the same way they were for the Saturn V\\'s.  (A side note: the    Saturn V\\'s also had a roll program.  Don\\'t ask me why -- I\\'m a Shuttle    guy.)    I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics.He added that the \"roll    maneuver\" is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw.    The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons    stated.  The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping    the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance.  The yaw    component is used to determine the orbital inclination.  The total    maneuver is really expressed as a \"quaternion,\" a grad-level-math    concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element    array.    HOW TO RECEIVE THE NASA TV CHANNEL, NASA SELECT    NASA SELECT is broadcast by satellite. If you have access to a satellite    dish, you can find SELECT on Satcom F2R, Transponder 13, C-Band, 72    degrees West Longitude, Audio 6.8, Frequency 3960 MHz. F2R is stationed    over the Atlantic, and is increasingly difficult to receive from    California and points west. During events of special interest (e.g.    shuttle missions), SELECT is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite    for these viewers.    If you can\\'t get a satellite feed, some cable operators carry SELECT.    It\\'s worth asking if yours doesn\\'t.    The SELECT schedule is found in the NASA Headline News which is    frequently posted to sci.space.news. Generally it carries press    conferences, briefings by NASA officials, and live coverage of shuttle    missions and planetary encounters. SELECT has recently begun carrying    much more secondary material (associated with SPACELINK) when missions    are not being covered.

But, the Salyut KB (Design Bureau) was planning a new LH/LOX second stage for the Proton which would boostpayload to LEO from about 21000 to 31500 kg. (Geostationary goes from2600 kg. (Gals launcher version) to 6000 kg.. This scheme was competingwith the Energia-M last year and I haven't heard which won, except nowI recently read that the Central Specialized KB was working on the successor to the Soyuz booster which must be the Energia-M. So the earlyresults are Energia-M won, but this is a guess, nothing is very clear in Russia. I'm sure if Salyut KB gets funds from someone they will continue their development. The Centaur for the Altas is about 3 meters dia. and the Proton is 4 so that's a good fit for their existing upper stage, the Block-Dwhich sets inside a shround just under 4 meters dia. I don't know aboutlaunch loads, etc.. but since the Centaur survives Titan launches whichare probably worse than the Proton (those Titan SRB's probably shake thingsup pretty good) it seems feasible. EXCEPT, the Centaur is a very fragilething and may require integration on the pad which is not available now.Protons are assembled and transported horizontially. Does anyone know how much stress in the way of a payload a Centaur could support whilebolted to a Proton horizontally and then taken down the rail road trackand erected on the pad?  They would also need LOX and LH facilities added to the Proton pads (unless the new Proton second stage is actually built), and of courseany Centaur support systems and facilities, no doubt imported from theUS at great cost. These systems may viloate US law so there are politicalproblems to solve in addition to the instabilities in the CIS you mention.

But that isonly for some of the players.

Of course I can\\'t say thisfor sure, but I believe that this is fairly typical of human nature and Idon\\'t think that hockey players are above having what I consider typicallyhuman attitudes.  With the recent salary escalations the key players are actually losing money by participating in the playoffs.  The ones who regard the playoff\"take\" as some kind of a bonanza are fringe players who are unlikelyto consistently be a force in the playoffs.  Now I know some of you aregoing to come back with \"winning spirit\" and all of that crap but theseplayers are professionals after all.  While they may love to play the game that love is entirely incidental to their purpose, which is, to makea decent living. Of course, the coach is a professional as well, and part of what he is being paid to do is motivate the players.  So, if the coach does hisjob well enough the players may respond with a winning effort.The second season, is after all, merely an exhibition.  The true Championsof the league are the division winners, the teams that come out on top after the long struggle of the season.  The Stanley cup playoffs merelyaccord victory to the team that has remained healthy and \"hot\".  The emphasis on the playoffs, with their \"sudden death\" appeal has been promotedby the media and the owners with profit purely in mind.  Even if Pittsburghloses the playoffs, we all know that they were really the best team in theleague over the year.

If you decide in advance that your reason will act only onthe evidence of the five physical senses, then you cut reason off from anypossibility of reaching a conclusion outside the physical sphere (beyond therather provocative, if inconclusive, conclusion that the physical sphereis not self explanatory). Christians claim that they have received a different kind of evidence, which they call faith, and which is a gift of God. That is, this evidenceis the evidence of a thing which chooses to reveal or hide itself. The evidence of the senses cannot tell you is such a ting exists. Reasoningon the evidence of the senses won\\'t help either. But Christians do reasonof the evidence of faith, and do claim that this evidence is whollyconsistent with the evidence of the other senses, and indeed, that theevidence of these other senses is part of God\\'s revelation of himselfto us.It is not necessarilly the case however that knowledge of a God must comethrough this route. There may be other senses than the physical onesproviding evidence of non-physical realities. (There may, of course, bephysical realities of a type for which we have no corresponding senses, forall we know.) These senses, if they exist, may provide valid evidence forreason to work on. And, as with all senses, these senses may be impairedin some people, that is, they may be spiritually blind. In this sense,belief in God becomes an act of sight, and it is disbelief which is blind.>You are right that science and reason cannot PROVE anything.  However, if>we do not use them we can only then believe on FAITH alone.  And since>we can only use faith, why is one picture of \"God\" (e.g. Hinduism) any less>valid than another (e.g. Christianity)?>Faith, as I have said, is not opposed to reason, it is simply a new source of evidence on which reason may operate. It is clear that human beingshave many systems for explaining the evidence of the physical senses, andsimilarly there are many systems for explaining the evidence provided byfaith. Religious believers in general, and Christians in particular, usereason to help sift through the evidence to come to a clearer understandingof the evidence provided by faith. Science claims, with good reason, to bethe most valid system for explaining the physical universe, and Christianityclaims, also with good reason, to be the most valid system, possessed of thebest evidence, for explaining Gods revelations of himself to man.If you doubt that Christians use reason, read this newsgroup for a whileand you will see rational debate aplenty.-- ==============================================================================Mark Baker                  | \"The task ... is not to cut down jungles, but aa888@Freenet.carleton.ca   | to irrigate deserts.\" -- C.

Tough question -- more dangerous than driving a car, and far moredangerous if you don\\'t apply a modicum of intelligence to the activity.  Basically, stupidity will get you hurt/killed a lotfaster on a motorcycle than in a car.  But with care, it isnot unreasonably dangerous.  Also, buying good protectiveclothing is helpful, that way if something does go wrong,you are likely to be less severely injured.First thing, if possible take a (MSF) driver training course,this will get you started on the right foot -- they teachcontrol of the vehicle and safe riding practices.Second, buy protective gear.  At minimum a good helmetand a pair of leather gloves are a must.  A good sturdy piece of footgear is also very helpful, though leather hikingboots, a pair of old army boots, or something similar works finefor this purpose as long as you make sure the laces stay tied.  After those, a leather jacket and leather pants or chapsare nice as well; but these are also expensive items.  For thepants, many people consider a good pair of jeans to be reasonable,preferably recent and of a fairly heavy weight.  Similarly fora jacket, a good jean jacket is a reasonable compromise, thoughmore people tend to have leather jackets around than pants.  Anotherthing to do is drop in on garage sales looking for a second-handleather jacket.  Look for a fairly thick leather in these items.Third don\\'t do anything stupid -- don\\'t ride after drinking, even one drink can noticeably affect you judgementand balance; don\\'t ride in the snow, or when conditionsare such that black ice is likely; be very careful ridingin the rain -- slow way down, take corners gingerly, brake early and gently;  try not to ride if you are sick,tired, taking any medication with drowsiness warnings, orotherwise not in average shape.With care, you should be ok.>The next question I have is what bike would you recommend for>a first time rider.

Ifyou are shorter/lighter than average, you might want to go aslow as a 300-400 cc bike.Possible models: The Suzuki GS### series (eg. GS500, GS650, etc.).  These are generallyinline 4 bikes, generally dependable except for a tendency to weakness in the charging system.  (Stator and/or Regulator/Rectifier problems.)  My first bike was a (about \\'82) GS650, it server me well.The Honda Nighthawk series (this may also be known as the CB### seriesI think).  eg. Honda CB450, CB650, etc.  This is another series ofstandard motorcycles.  Also fairly dependable.Kawasaki and Yamaha probably have similar bikes, but I don\\'t knowthem as well.For mid to late \\'80s models of the above, you should be able tobuy the bike for under $2000, leaving you money for protective clothing and insurance and licensing costs.Hope this helps,-David(dagibbs@qnx.com)',\n",

If I read you right, you\\'re saying in essence that, with a larger   economy, nations will have more discretionary funds to *waste* on a   lunar facility. That was certainly partially the case with Apollo,   but real Lunar colonies will probably require a continuing   military, scientific, or commercial reason for being rather than   just a \"we have the money, why not?\" approach.Ah, but the whole point is that money spent on a lunar base is notwasted on the moon. It\\'s not like they\\'d be using $1000 (1000R?) billsto fuel their moon-dozers. The money to fund a lunar base would bespent in the country to which the base belonged. It\\'s a way of fundinghigh-tech research, just like DARPA was a good excuse to fund variousfields of research, under the pretense that it was crucial to thedefense of the country, or like ESPRIT is a good excuse for the EC tofund research, under the pretense that it\\'s good for pan-Europeancooperation.Now maybe you think that government-funded research is a waste ofmoney (in fact, I\\'m pretty sure you do), but it does count asinvestment spending, which does boost the economy (and just look atthe size of that multiplier :->).Nick Haines nickh@cmu.edu',\n",

Jeff Brown and Denny Felsner scored the other Blues goals.Brian Noonan had the hat trick for the Hawks, who also had some very goodgoaltending from Ed Belfour. Blues goalie Curtis Joseph was solid down thestretch to preserve the Blues lead.The Hawks came out strong in the first period, outshooting the Blues 6-1 andtaking a 1-0 lead on Noonan's first goal. Right after an interference penaltyon Rick Zombo had expired, Keith Brown intercepted a clearing attempt at theblue line and passed the puck to Steve Larmer in the right circle. Larmer fireda long slap shot, and Noonan deflected the puck between Joseph's pads. Afterthe goal, the Blues picked up the intensity and went on to outshoot the Hawks10-9 in the first period.Jeff Brown tied the game 1-1 at 3:12 of the second. Nelson Emerson broke in onthe left side, got by Craig Muni and pushed the puck across the slot. Belfourcame out to play the pass and shoveled it to the right boards, where Browncollected it and slapped it in before Belfour could get back to the goal.Two minutes later on a Hawks power play, Belfour stopped Rich Sutter on ashort-handed break-in. Chris Chelios picked up the puck and passed it to JeremyRoenick who carried it on right wing and found an open Noonan with a nice passacross the slot. Noonan fired it past Joseph at 5:30 for the 2-1 lead.Noonan completed his hat trick 3:11 later to increase the Hawks' lead to 3-1.Stephane Matteau made a nice pass from the right boards to Noonan who beatStephane Quintal by driving to the net. Joseph had no chance as Noonandeflected the puck in the net.Denny Felsner reduced the Blues deficit to 3-1 at 12:49 after picking up therebound of Basil McRae's slap shot from the slot. Janney set up McRae forthe shot, and the puck sailed wide of the net and bounced off the end boardsto Felsner. Felsner sticked the rebound into the partially open net. The Bluesoutshot the Hawks 10-5 in the second period.With the Blackhawks leading 3-2 at 9:56 of the third, Stephane Matteau pickedup a high sticking penalty. Just 53 seconds into the power play, Steve Smithwas called for slashing, giving the Blues a 5-on-3 advantage for 1:07.The Blues didn't waste time as Brendan Shanahan scored just 23 seconds intothe two-man advantage to tie the game 3-3. Janney found Hull in the slot,and Hull fired a rocket at Belfour. Jeff Brown collected the rebound andpassed it to Shanahan in the left circle. Shanahan beat Belfour from a sharpangle.Just 17 seconds later, Hull scored the game winner for the Blues. NelsonEmerson broke in on right wing, carried the puck behind the net along withtwo Hawks defensemen. Emerson made a nice pass to an unchecked Hull in theslot, and Hull beat Belfour to put the Blues up 4-3.The Hawks had several chances to tie the game in the final minutes, but Josephmade some brilliant saves to prevent the Hawks from scoring. He stopped TroyMurray point blank from just right of the crease with 2:30 left in the game.The Blues killed off a late Hawks power play, with Rich Sutter clearing thepuck with his hand as it was trickling along the goal line. The Blues heldon to win the game. The Hawks oushot the Blues 13-7 in the third period,totaling 27 shots on goal for each team. The Blues special teams were excellentin the game. The Blues killed 6 of 7 Hawks power plays, and scored twice onon four power play chances. The Blues ranked among the best special teams inthe league. They rank 2nd in penalty killing and 3rd on the power play.

Anybody know?I don\\'t know, but I\\'m as willing to speculate as anyone.Several people have suggested that the chips use public-key cryptography.Another possibility is to use Diffie-Hellman key exchange, or some otheralgorithm which has a similar effect.  DH allows both ends to agree ona session key which they use with symmetric cryptography (somethinglike DES) for the encryption.How could the \"back door\" keys work in this system?  I can see a fewpossibilities.  One is that the DH-like algorithm has the property thatthe session key can be deduced by an eavesdropper who knows the back doorkeys for one (or possibly both) communicants.  Perhaps the random numbersused in the DH are seeded by the back door key, or some such.Another possibility, as was suggested here earlier, is that the chipssimply broadcast the session key, encrypted with the chip\\'s owninternal secret key.  In this system the back door keys are secret keysusable for decrypting this session key broadcast.  Actually the chip\\'ssecret key doesn\\'t need to be a public key in this usage, but can beidentical to the secret back-door key.  (This proposal seems moststraightforward to me.)Still another possibility is that the encryption algorithm used for themessage itself has a \"dual key\" property, that possession of either oftwo keys can be used to decrypt it.  One key would be the session key fromthe DH exchange, and the other would be the back door key for the chip.It\\'s worth noting that one of the proposals Dorothy Denning raisedduring her amazingly prescient on-line discussion last November andDecember was a variation on Diffie-Hellman in which a third party wouldparticipate in deriving the session keys.  This doesn\\'t quite fit intowhat we know of how Clipper works but it hints that those who had earlyknowledge of Clipper (or whose thinking was somehow synchronized withClipper designers) may have had Diffie-Hellman on their minds.Hal Finney',\n",

Is it half-duplex or truly one way?  I\\'m guessing half-duplex    since the host can turn LEDs on and off.3.  Are there any chipsets available for communicating with the \"AT    keyboard standard\" (other than by cannibalizing a real keyboard)?If anyone knows of a book or article (or any other written source ofinformation) on the above, please advise me at gamet@erg.sri.com.Whatever I do it must be safe for I cannot afford to replace the 486 inthe event of a booboo.Thank you for your time.Danke fuer Ihre Zeit.Thomas Gamet (gamet@erg.sri.com)Software EngineerSRI International',\n",

What was he killed for. He hadn\\'t hurt anyone, hadn\\'t said any word he oughtn\\'t have. Why did they kill him? I want to find out--from here, from there, from the government--why my husband was killed.On the 27th, when I returned from work--it was a Saturday--my son was at home.He doesn\\'t work. I went straight to the kitchen, and he called me, \"Mamma, is there a soccer game?\" There were shouts from Lenin Street. That\\'s where we lived. I say, \"I don\\'t know, Igor, I haven\\'t turned on the TV.\" He looked again and said, \"Mamma, what\\'s going on in the courtyard?!\" I look and see so many people, it\\'s awful, marching, marching, there are hundreds, thousands, you can\\'t even tell how many there are. They\\'re shouting, \"Down with the Armenians! Kill the Armenians! Tear the Armenians to pieces!\" My God, why is that happening, what for? I had known nothing at that point. We lived togetherwell, in friendship, and suddenly something like this. It was completely unexpected. And they were shouting, \"Long live Turkey!\" And they had flags,and they were shouting. There was a man walking in front well dressed, he\\'s around 40 or 45, in a gray raincoat. He is walking and saying something, I can\\'t make it out through the vent window. He is walking and saying something,and the children behind him are shouting, \"Tear the Armenians to pieces!\" and \"Down with the Armenians!\" They shout it again, and then shout, \"Hurrah!\" The people streamed without end, they were walking in groups, and in the groups I saw that there were women, too. I say, \"My God, there are women there too!\" And my son says, \"Those aren\\'t women, Mamma, those are bad women.\" Well we didn\\'t look a long time. They were walking and shouting and I was afraid, I simply couldn\\'t sit still. I went out onto the balcony, and my Azerbaijani neighbor is on the other balcony, and I say, \"Khalida, what\\'s going on, what happened?\" She says, \"Emma, I don\\'t know, I don\\'t know, I don\\'t know what happened.\" Well she was quite frightened too. They had these white sticks, each second or third one had a white rod. They\\'re waving the rods above their heads as they walk, and the one who\\'s out front, like a leader, he has a whitestick too. Well maybe it was an armature shaft, but what I saw was white, I don\\'t know.My husband got home 10 or 15 minutes later. He comes home and I say, \"Oh dear, I\\'m frightened, they\\'re going to kill us I bet.\" And he says, \"What are you afraid of, they\\'re just children.\" I say, \"Everything that happens comes from children.\" There had been 15- and 16-year kids from the Technical and Vocational School. \"Don\\'t fear,\" he said, \"it\\'s nothing, nothing all that bad.\" He didn\\'t eat, he just lay on the sofa. And just then on television theybroadcast that two Azerbaijanis had been killed in Karabakh, near Askeran. When I heard that I couldn\\'t settle down at all, I kept walking here and there and I said, \"They\\'re going to kill us, the Azerbaijanis are going to kill us.\" And he says, \"Don\\'t be afraid.\" Then we heard--from the central square, there are women shouting near near the stage, well, they\\'re shoutingdifferent things, and you couldn\\'t hear every well. I say, \"You speakAzerbaijani well, listen to what they\\'re saying.\" He says \"Close the windowand go to bed, there s nothing happening there.\" He listened a bit and then closed the window and went to bed, and told us, \"Come on, go to sleep, it\\'snothing.\" Sleep, what did he mean sleep?  My Son and I stood at the windowuntil two in the morning watching. Well he\\'s sick, and all of this wasaffecting him. I say, \"Igor, you go to bed, I\\'m going to go to bed in a minutetoo.\" He went and I sat at the window until three, and then went to bed. Things had calmed down slightly.The 28th, Sunday, was my day off. My husband got up and said, \"Come on, Emma, get up.\" I say, \"Today\\'s my day off, let me rest.\" He says, \"Aren\\'t you going to make me some tea?\" Well I felt startled and got up, and said, \"Where are you going?\" He says, \"I\\'m going out, I have to.\" I say, \"Can you really go outside on a day like today? Don\\'t go out, for God\\'s sake. You never listen tome, I know, and you\\'re not going to listen to me now, but at least don\\'t take the car out of the garage, go without the car.\" And he says, \"Come on, close the door!\" And then on the staircase he muttered something, I couldn\\'t make itout, he probably said \"coward\" or something.I closed the door and he left. And I started cleaning . . . picking things uparound the house . . . Everything seemed quiet until one o\\'clock in the after-noon, but at the bus station, my neighbor told me, cars were burning. I said,\"Khalida, was it our car?\" She says, \"No, no, Emma, don\\'t be afraid, theywere government cars and Zhigulis.\\'\\' Our car is a GAZ-21 Volga. And I waited,it was four o\\'clock, five o\\'clock . . . and when he wasn\\'t home at seven Isaid, \"Oh, they\\'ve killed Shagen!\"Tires are burning in town, there\\'s black smoke in town, and I\\'m afraid, I\\'m standing on the balcony and I\\'m all . . . my whole body is shaking. My God, they\\'ve probably killed him! So basically I waited like that until ten o\\'clock and he still hadn\\'t come home. And I\\'m afraid to go out. At teno\\'clock I look out: across from our building is a building with a bookstore,and from upstairs, from the second floor, everything is being thrown outside. I\\'m looking out of one window and Igor is looking out of the other, and I don\\'t want him to see this, and he, as it turns out, doesn\\'t want me to see it. We wanted to hide it from one another. I joined him. \"Mamma,\" he says,\"look what they\\'re doing over there!\" They were burning everything, and there were police standing there, 10 or 15 of them, maybe twenty policemen standing on the side, and the crowd is on the other side, and two or three people are throwing everything down from the balcony. And one of the ones on the balcony is shouting, \"What are you standing there for, burn it!\" When they threw the television, wow, it was like a bomb! Our neighbor on the third floor came out on her balcony and shouted, \"Why are you doing that, why are you burning thosethings, those people saved with such difficulty to buy those things for their home. Why are you burning them?\" And from the courtyard they yell at her, \"Go inside, go inside! Instead why don\\'t you tell us if they are any of them in your building or not?\" They meant Armenians, but they didn\\'t say Armenians, they said, \"of them.\" She says, \"No, no, no, none!\" Then she ran downstairs toour place, and says, \"Emma, Emma, you have to leave!\" I say, \"They\\'ve killedShagen anyway, what do we have to live for? It won\\'t be living for me without Shagen. Let them kill us, too!\" She insists, saying, \"Emma, get out of here, go to Khalida\\'s, and give me the key. When they come I\\'ll say that it\\'s my daughter\\'s apartment, that they\\'re off visiting someone.\" I gave her the key and went to the neighbor\\'s, but I couldn\\'t endure it. I say, \"Igor, you stay here, I\\'m going to go downstairs, and see, maybe Papa\\'s . . . Papa\\'s there.\"Meanwhile, they were killing the two brothers, Alik and Valery [Albert and Valery Avanesians; see the accounts of Rima Avanesian and Alvina Baluian], in the courtyard. There is a crowd near the building, they\\'re shouting, howling, and I didn\\'t think that they were killing at the time. Alik and Valery livedin the corner house across from ours. When I went out into the courtyard I sawan Azerbaijani, our neighbor, a young man about 30 years old. I say, \"Madar, Uncle Shagen\\'s gone, let\\'s go see, maybe he\\'s dead in the garage or near the garage, let\\'s at least bring the corpse into the house. \"He shouts, \"Aunt Emma, where do you think you\\'re going?! Go back into the house, I\\'ll look for him.\" I say, \"Something will happen to you, too, because of me, no, Madar, I\\'m coming too.\" Well he wouldn\\'t let me go all the same, he says, \"You stay here with us, I\\'m go look.\" He went and looked, and came back and said, \"Aunt Emma, there\\'s no one there, the garage is closed. \"Madar went off again and then returned and said, \"Aunt Emma, they\\'re already killed Alik, and Valery\\'s there . . . wheezing.\"Madar wanted to go up to him, but those scoundrels said, \"Don\\'t go near him, or we\\'ll put you next to him.\" He got scared--he\\'s young--and came back and said, \"I\\'m going to go call, maybe an ambulance will come, at least to take Alik, maybe he\\'ll live . . . \" They grew up together in our courtyard, they knew each other well, they had always been on good terms. He went to call, butnot a single telephone worked, they had all been shut off. He called, and called, and called, and called--nothing.I went upstairs to the neighbor\\'s. Igor says, \"Two police cars drove up over there, their headlights are on, but they\\'re not touching them, they are still lying where they were, they\\'re still lying there . . . \"We watched out thewindow until four o\\'clock, and then went downstairs to our apartment. I didn\\'ttake my clothes off. I lay on the couch so as not to go to bed, and at sixo\\'clock in the morning I got up and said, \"Igor, you stay here at home, don\\'tgo out, don\\'t go anywhere, I\\'m going to look, I have to find Papa, dead oralive . . . let me go . . . I\\'ve got the keys from work.\"At six o\\'clock I went to the Emergency Hospital. The head doctor and another doctor opened the door to the morgue. I run up to them and say, \"Doctor, is Shagen there?\" He says, \"What do you mean? Why should Shagen be here?!\" I wanted to go in, but he wouldn\\'t let me. There were only four people in there,they said. Well, they must have been awful because they didn\\'t let me in. Theysaid, \"Shagen\\'s not here, he\\'s alive somewhere, he\\'ll come back.\"It\\'s already seven o\\'clock in the morning. I look and there is a panel truckwith three policemen. Some of our people from the hospital were there withthem. I say, \"Sara Baji [\"Sister\" Sara, term of endearment], go look, they\\'veprobably brought Shagen.\" I said it, shouted it, and she went and came backand says, \"No, Emma, he has tan shoes on, it\\'s a younger person.\" Now Shagen just happened to have tan shoes, light tan, they were already old. When they said it like that I guessed immediately. I went and said, \"Doctor, they\\'ve brought Shagen in dead.\" He says, \"Why are you carrying on like that, dead, dead . . . he\\'s alive.\" But then he went all the same, and when he came back the look on his face was . . . I could tell immediately that he was dead. Theyknew one another well, Shagen had worked for him a long time. I say, \"Doctor, is it Shagen?\" He says, \"No, Emma, it\\'s not he, it\\'s somebody else entirely.\" I say, \"Doctor, why are you deceiving me, I\\'ll find out all the same anyway, if not today, then tomorrow.\" And he said . . . I screamed, right there in theoffice. He says, \"Emma, go, go calm down a little.\" Another one of our colleagues said that the doctor had said it was Shagen, but . . . in hideous condition. They tried to calm me down, saying it wasn\\'t Shagen. A few minutes later another colleague comes in and says, \"Oh, poor Emma!\" When she said it like that there was no hope left.   That day was awful. They were endlessly bringing in dead and injured people.At night someone took me home. I said, \"Igor, Papa\\'s been killed.\"On the morning of the 1st I left Igor at home again and went to the hospital: I had to bury him somehow, do something. I look and see that the hospital is surrounded by soldiers. They are wearing dark clothes. \"Hey, citizen, where are you going?\" I say, \"I work here,\" and from inside someone shouts, \"Yes, yes, that\\'s our cook, let her in.\" I went right to the head doctor\\'s officeand there is a person from the City Health Department there, he used towork with us at the hospital. He says, \"Emma, Shagen\\'s been taken to Baku.In the night they took the wounded and the dead, all of them, to Baku.\" Isay, \"Doctor, how will I bury him?\" He says, \"We\\'re taking care of all that,don\\'t you worry, we\\'ll do everything, we\\'ll tell you about it. Where did youspend the night?\" I say, \"I was at home.\" He says, \"What do you mean youwere at home?! You were at home alone?\" I say, \"No, Igor was there too.\" Hesays, \"You can\\'t stay home, we\\'re getting an ambulance right now, wait justone second, the head doctor is coming, we\\'re arranging an ambulance rightnow, you put on a lab coat and take one for Igor, you go and bring Igor herelike a patient, and you\\'ll stay here and we\\'ll se~ later what to do next ...\"His last name is Kagramanov. The head doctor\\'s name is Izyat JamalogliSadukhov.The \"ambulance\" arrived and I went home and got Igor. They admitted him as a patient, they gave us a private room, an isolation room. We stayed in the hospital until the 4th.Some police car came and they said, \"Emma, let\\'s go.\" And the women, our colleagues, then they saw the police car, became anxious and said, \"Where are you taking her?\" I say, \"They\\'re going to kill me, too . . . \" And theinvestigator says, \"Why are you saying that, we\\'re going to make a positiveidentification.\" We went to Baku and they took me into the morgue . . . Istill can\\'t remember what hospital it was . . . The investigator says, \"Let\\'s go, we need to be certain, maybe it\\'s not Shagen.\" And when I saw the caskets,lying on top of one another, I went out of my mind. I say, \"I can\\'t look, no.\"The investigator says, \"Are there any identifying marks?\" I say, \"Let me seethe clothes, or the shoes, or even a sock, I\\'ll recognize them.\" He says, \"Isn\\'t they\\'re anything on his body?\" I say he has seven gold teeth and his finger, he only has half of one of his fingers. Shagen was a carpenter, he hadbeen injured at work . . .They brought one of the sleeves of the shirt and sweater he was wearing, they brought them and they were all burned . . . When I saw them I shouted, \"Oh, they burned him!\" I shouted, I don\\'t know, I fell down . . . or maybe I sat down, I don\\'t remember. And that investigator says, \"Well fine, fine, since we\\'ve identified that these are his clothes, and since his teeth . . . sincehe has seven gold teeth . . . \"On the 4th they told me: \"Emma, it\\'s time to bury Shagen now.\" I cried, \"How, how can I bury Shagen when I have only one son and he\\'s sick? I should inform his relatives, he has three sisters, I can\\'t do it by myself.\" They say, \"OK, you know the situation. How will they get here from Karabagh? How will they get here from Yerevan? There\\'s no transportation, it s impossible.\"He was killed on February 28, and I buried him on March 7. We buried him in Sumgait. They asked me, \"Where do you want to bury him?\" I said, \"I want to bury him in Karabagh, where we were born, let me bury him in Karabagh,\" I\\'m shouting, and the head of the burial office, I guess, says, \"Do you know what it means, take him to Karabagh?! It means arson!\" I say, \"What do you mean, arson? Don\\'t they know what\\'s going on in Karabagh? The whole world knows thatthey killed them, and I want to take him to Karabagh, I don\\'t have anyone anymore.\" I begged, I pleaded, I grieved, I even got down on my knees. Hesays, \"Let\\'s bury him here now, and in three months, in six months, a year, if it calms down, I\\'ll help you move him to Karabagh . . . \"Our trial was the first in Sumgait. It was concluded on May 16. At theinvestigation the murderer, Tale Ismailov, told how it all happened, but thenat the trial he . . . tried to wriggle . . . he tried to soften his crime. Then they brought a videotape recorder, I guess, and played it, and said, \"Ismailov, look, is that you?\" He says, \"Yes.\" \"Well look, here you\\'re describing everything as it was on the scene of the crime, right?\" He says, \"Yes.\" \"And now you\\'re telling it differently?\" He says, \"Well maybe I forgot!\" Like that.The witnesses and that criminal creep himself said that when the car was goingalong Mir Street, there was a crowd of about 80 people . . . Shagen had a Volga GAZ-21. The 80 people surrounded his car, and all 80 of them were involved. One of them was this Ismailov guy, this Tale. They--it\\'s unclearwho--started pulling Shagen out of the car. Well, one says from the left sideof the car, another says from the right side. They pulled off his sports jacket. He had a jacket on. Well they ask him, \"What\\'s your nationality?\" He says, \"Armenian.\" Well they say from the crowd they shouted, \"If he\\'s anArmenian, kill him, kill him!\" They started beating him, they broke seven ofhis ribs, and his heart . . . I don\\'t know, they did something there, too . . . it\\'s too awful to tell about. Anyway, they say this Tale guy . . . he had an armature shaft. He says, \"I picked it up, it was lying near a bush, that\\'s where I got it.\" He said he picked it up, but the witnesses say that hehad already had it. He said, \"I hit him twice,\" he said, \" . . . once or twiceon the head with that rod.\" And he said that when he started to beat him Shagen was sitting on the ground, and when he hit him he fell over. He said, \"I left, right nearby they were burning things or something in an apartment,killing someone,\" he says, \"and I came back to look, is that Shagen alive ornot?\" I said, \"You wanted to finish him, right, and if he was still alive, youcame back to hit him again?\" He went back and looked and he was already dead.\"After that,\" that bastard Tale said, \"after that I went home.\"I said, \"You . . . you . . . little snake,\" I said, \"Are you a thief and a murderer?\" Shagen had had money in his jacket, and a watch on his wrist. Theywere taken. He says he didn\\'t take themWhen they overturned and burned the car, that Tale was no longer there, it wasother people who did that. Who it was, who turned over the car and who burnedit, that hasn\\'t been clarified as yet. I told the investigator, \"How can you have the trial when you don\\'t know who burned the car?\" He said something, butI didn\\'t get what he was saying. But I said, \"You still haven\\'t straightened everything out, I think that\\'s unjust.\"When they burned the car he was lying next to it, and the fire spread to him. In the death certificate it says that he had third-degree burns over 80percent of his body . . .And I ask again, why was he killed? My husband was a carpenter; he was a good craftsman, he knew how to do everything, he even fixed his own car, with his own hands. We have three children. Three sons. Only Igor was with me at the time. The older one was in Pyatigorsk, and the younger one is serving in the Army. And now they\\'re fatherless...I couldn\\'t sit all the way through it. When the Procurator read up to 15years\\' deprivation of freedom, I just . . . I went out of my mind, I didn\\'tknow what to do with myself, I said, \"How can that be? You,\" I said, \"you are saying that it was intentional murder and the sentence is 15 years\\' deprivation of freedom?\" I screamed, I had my mind! I said, \"Let me at thatcreep, with my bare hands I\\'ll . . . \" A relative restrained me, and therewere all those military people there . . . I lest. I said,\" This isn\\'t a Soviet trial, this is unjust!\" That\\'s what I shouted, l said it and left . . .I said that on February 27, when those people were streaming down our street, they were shouting, \"Long live Turkey!\" and \"Glory to Turkey!\" And during the trial I said to that Ismailov, \"What does that mean, \\'Glory to Turkey\\'?\" I still don\\'t understand what Turkey has to do with this, we live in the Soviet Union. That Turkey told you to or is going to help you kill Armenians? I stilldon\\'t understand why \"Glory to Turkey!\" I asked that question twice and got noanswer . . . No one answered me . . .

The worst part is that John Campbell, thelong-time editor of Astounding/Analog SF magazine had cut a check forPiper's most recent story, and said check was in the mail.

It is disingeneous to compare their death to that of athletes in Munichor any other act of terrorism or mrder.  This exercise is aimed solely at diverting the issue and is far from the truth.It seems to me, Dorin, that, you are so remote and ignorant of the problemon the ground that your comments can only be charactrized as irrelevant,and heavily colored by the preconceptions and misinformation.I will try to paint the most accurate picture I can ofwhat the situation really is in South Lebanon.In article <1993Apr15.152455.14555@unocal.com>, stssdxb@st.unocal.com (Dorin Baru) writes:|> Is there any Israeli a civilian, in your opinion ?|> |> Now, I do not condone myself bombing villages, any kind of villages.|> But you claim these are villages with civilians, and Iraelis claim they are |> camps filled with terrorists. You claim that israelis shell the villages with the|> \\'hope\\' of finding a terrorist or so. If they kill one, fine, if not, too bad, |> civilians die, right ? I am not so sure. I am.  I was back in my home village this last summer.  For your informationwe are PEOPLE, not a bunch of indiscriminate terrorists.  Most of the people in my village are regular inhabitants that go about their dailybusiness, some work in the fields, some own small shops, others areolder men that go to the coffe shop and drink coffee.  Is that so hard toimagine ????  It is NOT a \"terrorist camp\" as you and the Israelis like to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccerin the streets, women preparing lunch, men playing cards, etc.....SOME young men, usually aged between 17 to 30 years are members ofthe Lebanese resistance.  Even the inhabitants of the village do not know who these are, they are secretive about it, but most people oftensuspect who they are and what they are up to.  These young men aresupported financially by Iran most of the time.  They sneak arms andammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby trapsfor Israeli patrols.  Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injuredby these traps, Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villagesof their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians.  Once theyare back they announce that they bombed a \"terrorist  hideout\" wherean 8 year old girl just happened to be.We are now accustomed to Israeli tactics, and we figure that this is the Israeli way of telling us that \"if you\\'re gonna hurt our soldiersyou\\'re gonna pay the price\".  We accept this as a price we have to payto free our land, Israel knows very well that it is not really hurtingthe resistance that much militarily with these strikes, but ratherjust keeping the pressure on the villagers to demand from their young men to stop attacking Israeli soldiers since these attacks aretaking a heavy toll on the lives of the civilian villagers.Israel\\'s retalliation policy is cold hearted, but a reality thatwe have come to accept and deal with, the Lebanese Resistanceon the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on OCCUPYING ISRAELI SOLDIERS until they withdraw, this is the only real leverage that they have to force Israel to withdraw.The people of South Lebanon are occupied, or shelled by Israel on a regular basis.  We do not want to be occupied.  If Israel insists thatthe so called \"Security Zone\" is necessary for the protection of Northern Israel, than it will have to pay the price of its occupationwith the blood of its soldiers.  If Israel is interested in peace,than it should withdraw from OUR land.  We are not asking for the establishment of a Lebanese occupied zone in northern Israel to protectour villages that are attacked on a regular basis by Israel, so thebest policy seems to be the removal of Israeli occupation and theestablishment of peace keeping troops along the border.I have written before on this very newsgroup, that the onlyreal solution will come as a result of a comprehensive peacesettlement whereby Israel withdraws to its own borders andpeace keeping troops are stationed along the border to insureno one on either side of the border is shelled.This is the only realistic solution, it is time for Israel torealize that the concept of a \"buffer zone\" aimed at protectingits northern cities has failed.  In fact it has caused much moreIsraeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israelwould have resulted in.  If Israel really wants to save some Israeli lives it would withdraw unilaterally from the so-called \"Security Zone\" before the conclusionof the peace talks.  Such a move would save Israeli lives,advance peace efforts, give Israel a great moral lift, better Israel\\'s public image abroad and give it an edge in the peace negociations since Israel can rightly claim that it is genuinely interested in peace and has already offered some important concessions.Along with such a withdrawal Israel could demand that Hizbollahbe disarmed by the Lebanese government and warn that it will not accept any attacks against its northern cities and that if such ashelling occurs than it will consider re-taking the buffer zoneand will hold the Lebanese and Syrian government responsible for it.There seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanesegoovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such circumstances, and now the Lebanese government has proven that it iscapable of controlling and disarming all militias as they didin all other parts of Lebanon.  |> If you ask me those questions, I will have no problem answering (not with a |> question, as you did) : No, NOBODY is qualified candidate for murder, nothing|> justifies murder.I agree, only in the case of the Isareli soldiers their killingCANNOT be qualified as murder, no matter what you say.

They habe been kept under occupation by Israel since 1967without civil and political rights. It is a fact that Gazans live in their own country, Palestine. Gaza isnot a foriegn country. Nor is TelAviv, Jaffa, Askalon, BeerSheba foreigncountry for Gazans. All these places are occupied as far as Palestiniansare concerned and as far as common sense has it. It is a fact that Zionists deny Gazans equal rights as Israeli citizensand the right to determine by themsevles their government. When Zionistswill begin to consider Gazans as human beings who deserve the samerights as themselves, there will be hope for peace. Not before.Somebody mentioned that Gaza is 'foreign country' and therefore Israelis entitled to close its borders to Gaza. In this case, Gaza should beentitled to reciprocate, and deny Israeli civilians and military personnelto enter the area. As the relation is not symmetrical, but that of a masterand slave, the label 'foreign country' is inaccurate and misleading.To close off 700,000 people in the Strip, deny them means of subsistenceand means of defending themselves, is a collective punishment and acrime. It is neither justifiable nor legal. It just reflects the abyss to which Israeli society has degraded. I would like to ask any of those who heap foul langauge on me to explainwhy Israel denies Gazans who were born and brought up in Jaffa to returnand live there ? Would they be allowed to, if they converted to Judaism ?Is their right to live in their former town depdendent upon theirreligion or ethnic origin ? Please give an honest answer.Elias\",\n",

The first two years consisted of five subjects:Software Engineering (Pascal/C/UNIX), Computer Engineering (6502/6809/68000 assembler), Computer Theory (LISP/Prolog), Mathematics/Statistics and Communication Skills (How to pass interviews/intelligence tests and groupdiscussions e.g. How to survive a helicopter crash in the North Sea).The third year (Industrial placement) was spent working for a computer company for a year. The company could be anywhere in Europe (there was a special Travel Allowance Scheme to cover the visiting costs of professors).  The fourth year included Operating Systems(C/Modula-2), Software Engineering (C/8086 assembler), Real Time Laboratory (C/68000 assembler) and Computing Theory (LISP).  There were also Group Projects in 2nd and 4th Years, where students worked in teams to select their own project or decide to work for an outside company (the only disadvantage being that specifications would change suddenly). In the first four years, there was a 50%:50% weighting between courseworks and exams for most subjects. However in the Honours year, this was reduced to a 30%:70% split between an Individual Project and final exams (no coursework assessment) - are all Computer Science courses like this?BTW - we started off with 22 students in our first year and were left with 8 byHonours year.

Currently I have  8 megabytes of RAM installed via eight 1 MG SIMMS on the motherboard: ie.  both banks are full, and there is no space for more SIMMS.  I am thinking  of running OS2 on my machine and Possibly Linux with X windows, and I know  that more RAM would be helpful.  However with SIMMS, the only solution I  can see is to sell my 8 Megs for about $180, and by 4 4mg SIMMS for about  $400 used. Apart from the fact that I can't afford the price right now,  the entire process of selling RAM and buying it used probably means that  the machine might be down for a number of days which I would rather  avoid...So my question is, do the AT RAM boards that plug into a free slot work  well with a 486 ISA machine. I have seen some being sold used for about  $90 with 4 Mg with space for another 4Mg's.  If these boards do work, how  do they do it?  Is a device driver needed, or will the BIOS pickup the  extra RAM as it does with the SIMMS on the mother board? I know that the  ISA expansions slots are 16-bits and 486 SIMM memory is 32 bits, so  probably all of this is just wishful thinking...

Between Adam and Eve and Golgotha the whole process of the fall of manoccurred.  This involved a gradual dimming of consciousness of the spiritualworld.  This is discernable in the world outlooks of different peoples throughhistory.  The Greek, for example, could say, \"better a beggar in the landof the living than a king in the land of the dead.\" (Iliad, I think).The question of what happens to human beings who died before Christ isan ever present one with Christians.  I am not ready to conscign Adamor Abraham, or even Cain to eternal damnation.  Yet they all died in theirsins, in the Christian sense.  The same can be said of the whole of  Gentilehumanity, and also of the unrepentant malefactor on the cross next tohim.

It is possible to experience eternity in a passing moment.  Therelationship of eternity to duration is not simply one of indefinitelyextended conditions of Greenwich mean time. It is possible to imaginean eternity of agony or bliss - or even many of them - in thespiritual world during the time between earthly death and a new birth.It was also a standard belief among many peoples that even the righteouswere lost.

Even if they were passedon, the question is, to what extent did they reflect real perceptionand experience?  The similarity in the midst of great variety ofexpression of the different people\\'s ideas of the time immediatelyafter death testifies to the presence of an underlying reality.  Inany case, we study geometry not by reading old manuscripts of Euclid,but by contemplating the principles themselves.On the other hand, there is one notion firmly embedded in Christianitythat originated most definitely in a pagan source.  The idea that thehuman being consists essentially of soul only, and that the soul iscreated at birth, was consciously adopted from Aristotle, whose ideasdominated Christian thought for fifteen hundred years and still doestoday. He was at once the father of modern thought and at the sametime lived during that darkened time when the perception of oureternal spiritual being had grown dim.>maybe at sometime in the future-  Indeed. I should also clarify that I do not deny that eternalirrevocable damnation is a real possibility.

FACT SHEET                  PUBLIC ENCRYPTION MANAGEMENTThe President has approved a directive on \"Public EncryptionManagement.\"  The directive provides for the following:Advanced telecommunications and commercially available encryptionare part of a wave of new computer and communications technology. Encryption products scramble information to protect the privacy ofcommunications and data by preventing unauthorized access. Advanced telecommunications systems use digital technology torapidly and precisely handle a high volume of communications. These advanced telecommunications systems are integral to theinfrastructure needed to ensure economic competitiveness in theinformation age.Despite its benefits, new communications technology can alsofrustrate lawful government electronic surveillance.  Sophisticatedencryption can have this effect in the United States.  Whenexported abroad, it can be used to thwart foreign intelligenceactivities critical to our national interests.  In the past, it hasbeen possible to preserve a government capability to conductelectronic surveillance in furtherance of legitimate lawenforcement and national security interests, while at the same timeprotecting the privacy and civil liberties of all citizens.  Asencryption technology improves, doing so will require new,innovative approaches.In the area of communications encryption, the U. S. Government hasdeveloped a microcircuit that not only provides privacy throughencryption that is substantially more robust than the currentgovernment standard, but also permits escrowing of the keys neededto unlock the encryption.  The system for the escrowing of keyswill allow the government to gain access to encrypted informationonly with appropriate legal authorization.To assist law enforcement and other government agencies to collectand decrypt, under legal authority, electronically transmittedinformation, I hereby direct the following action to be taken:INSTALLATION OF GOVERNMENT-DEVELOPED MICROCIRCUITSThe Attorney General of the United States, or her representative,shall request manufacturers of communications hardware whichincorporates encryption to install the U.S. government-developedkey-escrow microcircuits in their products.  The fact of lawenforcement access to the escrowed keys will not be concealed fromthe American public.  All appropriate steps shall be taken toensure that any existing or future versions of the key-escrowmicrocircuit are made widely available to U.S. communicationshardware manufacturers, consistent with the need to ensure thesecurity of the key-escrow system.  In making this decision, I donot intend to prevent the private sector from developing, or thegovernment from approving, other microcircuits or algorithms thatare equally effective in assuring both privacy and a secure key-escrow system.KEY-ESCROWThe Attorney General shall make all arrangements with appropriateentities to hold the keys for the key-escrow microcircuitsinstalled in communications equipment.  In each case, the keyholder must agree to strict security procedures to preventunauthorized release of the keys.  The keys shall be released onlyto government agencies that have established their authority toacquire the content of those communications that have beenencrypted by devices containing the microcircuits.  The AttorneyGeneral shall review for legal sufficiency the procedures by whichan agency establishes its authority to acquire the content of suchcommunications.PROCUREMENT AND USE OF ENCRYPTION DEVICESThe Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with other appropriateU.S. agencies, shall initiate a process to write standards tofacilitate the procurement and use of encryption devices fittedwith key-escrow microcircuits in federal communications systemsthat process sensitive but unclassified information.  I expect thisprocess to proceed on a schedule that will permit promulgation ofa final standard within six months of this directive. The Attorney General will procure and utilize encryption devices tothe extent needed to preserve the government\\'s ability to conductlawful electronic surveillance and to fulfill the need for securelaw enforcement communications.  Further, the Attorney Generalshall utilize funds from the Department of Justice Asset ForfeitureSuper Surplus Fund to effect this purchase.',\n",

(They do account for a somewhat largerportion of the difference in physicians\\' gross income in the two countries.)Some facts.  Malpractice insurance and awards account for less than 1% oftotal health care costs in the US.  In 1991, according to a survey of physicians conducted by a national medical journal physicians averagedpaying 3.7% of their practice receipts in malpractice insurance.  Malpractice insurance premiums and malpractice awards peaked in 1985;they\\'ve declined significantly since then.  At the same time, healthcare costs have increased more than any period in history.As far as \"defensive medicine\" is concerned, the AMA estimates that itstotal impact is about $7 billion per year.  That\\'s about 8% of the totalcurrent INCREASE in health care costs -- and the estimate is from a groupthat could be expected to overestimate the impacts of defensive medicineon health care.As small a problem as this is in the overall scheme of things, however,Clinton has been on record for a long time favoring an indemnificationof MD\\'s against malpractice suits if they follow procedures set by theirspecialties.  This would eliminate most, if not all frivolous suitswhile retaining the ability to sue for true malpractice.jsh--Steve Hendricks                        |  DOMAIN:  steveh@thor.ISC-BR.COM   \"One thing about data, it sure does cut|  UUCP:    ...!uunet!isc-br!thor!steveh the bulls**t.\" - R.

After reading the text some distinct questionsarised to me, which I guess will also be asked by other people. Perhapswould it be interesting to find an answer to these questions ?>                      THE CLIPPER CHIP: A TECHNICAL SUMMARY>    N, a 30-bit serial number (this length is subject to change)shorter or longer ?> Once the session key K is established, the Clipper Chip is used to> encrypt the conversation or message stream M (digitized voice).

The law enforcement> field thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U> concatenated with the serial number N, all encrypted under the family> key F.  The law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after> an authorized wiretap has been installed.First question: When will the LawEnforcmentField be transmitted, and howdoes the remote Clipper Chip handle it? Is it transmitted periodicallyin the stream of encrypted blocks, or just at the beginning ? Does thephone at the other side discard those packets via a protocol whatsoever,or tries it to turn them into voice-output ?

Thus, the unit keys are a> function of 160 secret, random bits, where each agent knows only 80.Second question: Why!?!? Why is such a strange procedure used, and nota real RNG ?

This would be a unique possibility to realize such a technicalrestriction, by letting the escrow-agencies perform the decoding of thesession key. Just take modem-lines instead of secure fax.

In fact, by 1942, Nazi Armenians in Europe had established a vast network of pro-German collaborators, that extended over two continents. Thousands of Armenians were serving the German army and Waffen-SS in Russia and Western Europe. Armenians were involved in espionage and fifth-column activities for Hitler in the Balkans and Arabian Peninsula. They were promised an \\'independent\\' state under German \\'protection\\' in an agreement signed by the \\'Armenian National Council.\\' (A copy of this agreement can be found in the \\'Congressional Record,\\' November 1, 1945; see Document 1.) On this side of the Atlantic, Nazi Armenians were aware of their brethrens alliance. They had often expressed pro-Nazi sentiments until America entered the war. In summary,during World War II Armenians were carried away with the German might andcringing and fawning over the Nazis. In that zeal, the Armenian publicationin Germany, Hairenik, carried statements as follows:[1]\"Sometimes it is difficult to eradicate these poisonous elements (the Jews) when they have struck deep root like a chronic disease, and when it  becomes necessary for a people (the Nazis) to eradicate them in an uncommon method, these attempts are regarded as revolutionary. During the surgical operation, the flow of blood is a natural thing.\" Now for a brief view of the Armenian genocide of the Muslims and Jews -extracts from a letter dated December 11, 1983, published in the SanFrancisco Chronicle, as an answer to a letter that had been publishedin the same journal under the signature of one B. Amarian. \"...We have first hand information and evidence of Armenian atrocities  against our people (Jews)...Members of our family witnessed the   murder of 148 members of our family near Erzurum, Turkey, by Armenian   neighbors, bent on destroying anything and anybody remotely Jewish   and/or Muslim. Armenians should look to their own history and see   the havoc they and their ancestors perpetrated upon their neighbors...  Armenians were in league with Hitler in the last war, on his premise   to grant them self government if, in return, the Armenians would   help exterminate Jews...Armenians were also hearty proponents of  the anti-Semitic acts in league with the Russian Communists.

As the box below shows, he has *one* minor leagueseason in which he hit well. He has two in which he hit very, verypoorly. I want to see that the 92 Lopez is real. Olson and Berryhillare not complete mediocrities; for catchers, especially NL catchers,they are essentially average hitters, with equivalent averages around.220. If he had hit well at prior levels, I would say he belongs onthe Braves; but there is a reasonable chance that Lopez last year wasjust as much a fluke as Alomar in 90 or Santiago in 87. One year atany level, at any age, doesn\\'t satisfy MY standards of evidence.

Granted, I thought his behavior withMcCarver last year was completely bush. Last year was the first timehe ever got 300 AB in one place, so his lines are hard to read. But hehas a combined 720 OPS in minor league play; with his speed is morevaluable than the OPS alone indicates; and at a still young age (24),had a monster year with an 868 OPS. He has a total, major and minor,EQA of .249; above major league average, and above average for CF(which was about .240 in the NL last year). He has shown at least thepotential of going into the .290s, which would make him one of the 15best hitters in the league. He has two full seasons before reachinghis \"prime\" season of 27. He should be considered as a legitimateprospect, and not as a simple side-show attraction.

There is no limit in the Constitution to the President\\'s veto powerregarding what a bill is for.

Why is it not a reasonable restriction?  Because 51 Senatorsis the magic holy number upon which Laws must be based?

Why *shouldn\\'t* a super-majoritybe required?       Any system in which the simple majority is given absolute powerto ignore the minority then the minority *will* be ignored.

The question is NOT which system would solve the ME problem. Why ? because   any system can solve it.    The laws of minister Sharon says kick Palestineans out of here (all palestine).

Now that I have straightened that out, I\\'m eagerly awaiting your reply.   Joseph Weitz (administrator responsible for Jewish colonization)    said it best when writing in his diary in 1940:   \"Between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both   peoples together in this country.... We shall not achieve our goal^^^                  ^^^   of being an independent people with the Arabs in this small country.   The only solution is a Palestine, at least Western Palestine (west of   the Jordan river) without Arabs.... And there is no other way than   to transfer the Arabs from here to the neighbouring countries, to   transfer all of them; not one village, not one tribe, should be    left.... Only after this transfer will the country be able to   absorb the millions of our own brethren. There is no other way out.\"   DAVAR, 29 September, 1967   (\"Courtesy\" of Marc Afifi)Just a question: If we are to disregard the rather obvious references to getting Israel out of ME one way or the other in both PLO covenant and HAMAScharter (that\\'s the english translations, if you have other information I\\'dbe interested to have you translate it) why should we give any credence to a _private_ paper even older?

We shall never be roughand heartless when it is not necessary, that is clear. We Germans,who are the only people in the world who have a decent attitudetowards animals, will also assume a decent attitude towards thesehuman animals. But it is a crime against our own blood to worryabout them and give them ideals, thus causing our sons andgrandsons to have a more difficult time with them. When someonecomes to me and says, \"I cannot dig the anti-tank ditch with womenand children, it is inhuman, for it will kill them\", then Iwould have to say, \"you are a murderer of your own blood becauseif the anti-tank ditch is not dug, German soldiers will die, andthey are the sons of German mothers. They are our own blood\".Extract from Himmler\\'s address to party comrades, September 7 1940[\"Trials of Wa Criminals\", Vol. IV, p. 1140]------------------------------------------------------------------If any Pole has any sexual dealing with a German woman, and by thisI mean sexual intercourse, then the man will be hanged right infront of his camp. Then the others will not do it. Besides,provisions will be made that a sufficient number of Polish womenand girls will come along as well so that a necessity of thiskind is out of the question.The women will be brought before the courts without mercy, andwhere the facts are not sufficiently proved - such borderlinecases always happen - they will be sent to a concentration camp.This we must do, unless these one million Poles and thosehundreds of thousands of workers of alien blood are to inflictuntold damage on the German blood. Philosophizing is of no availin this case. It would be better if we did not have them at all -we all know that - but we need them.-Danny Keren.',\n",

My argument is that the sole purpose of the death penalty is to  kill people.  That is it's primary (and I would argue only)  purpose.  To continue to kill people by a practice that has  almost no utility, especially when you know you will be killing  innocents, is unconscionable.  At the very least, the existence of the prison system and our  transportation system are based on their merits to society, not  their detriments.  We are willing to accept a few lost innocent  lives because there is an overwhelming benefit to the continued  existence of these systems.  One has to stretch the evidence and  the arguments to make the same claim for capital punishment.  Just in case I wasn't clear again:  We maintain a capital  punsihment system that kills innocent people and provides us with  no net positive gain.  Why?  Were you to pin me in a corner and ask, I would have to respond  that I don't belief the state should have the right to take life  at all.

They can be used to reveal the>presence of knives, axes, weapons and other sharp objects.>>In addition to the gates, which will be operated by a private>civilian company, large quantities of magnetic-card reading>devices are being brought to the inspection points, to facilitate>the reading of the magnetic cards these [non-Jewish] workers must>carry.    A laudable precaution.          Every single thing you post about Israel is posted to portray    Israel as negatively as you can.  Deliberate omissions are an    integral part of the shtick.  And it\\'s not only the incidents    that you do not mention, but even the stories you do post are    fraught with omissions, which change the entire meaning.  The    absurdity of your respectable name cannot hide your bias.    In your effort to portray Israel in an unfavorable light, you     have accomplished nothing, except to prove that a respectable     sounding label like the Center for Policy Research is nothing     but a smoke screen for someone with a heavily biased attitude     against Israel and the need to vent it.  You         This \\'Center for Policy Research\\' stuff is nonsense.',\n",

But the demonstration of thisproduct really impressive, if it didn't cheat.The setup of the demo is fairly simple. A cone shaped rotor ishalf submerged in a small oil sink, filled with motor oil. The rotoris powered by an electronic motor. A metal pad is pressed againstthe rotor using the torque wrench until the rotor stopped by friction. The torque that is needed to stop rotor is read from the torque wrench.Before MILITECH was added, the rotor was stopped with about 60 lb-ftof torque (You pick the brand of oil, no difference). Once MILITECH was added to the oil, the rotor could not be stopped even with 120+ lb-ft oftorque. Here is the good part: even after the salesman emptied the oil sink, you still could not stopped the rotor with the thin film remained  on it.They say you need only add 2oz per quart of oil every 15k miles. A 16 ozbottle is $25.I still have my doubts. If this product is really so great, why it wasso little known? The salesman said it is widely used in military. I didn'tbelieve it.  The demo was so impressive, that I bought a bottle againstmy common sense.Has anyone heard of or actually used this product? Is it real?If you are going to the auto show, please visit this stand on the second floor. See if can find out if the demo is a hoax or not.Jason Chen\",\n",

Even if we assume that these \"trusted agents\" are really enteringa wide range of S1 and S2 seeds (rather than using the same one all thetime to reduce the key search space to 30 bits), I assume they are notdoing so by picking up an iron filing and poking it into the circuitryat carefully selected points to encode data.  They would presumably bepunching numbers into a computer, which for all they know could programthe chips in a manner completely independent of the S1 and S2 values theyare feeding into the system.S1 and S2 are clearly the backdoor - we should assume they are allcompromised.

This is a second RFD, replacingthe one originally posted in January \\'93 (and never taken to a vote).  Theproposed groups are described below:NAME:  comp.os.ms-windows.nt.setupSTATUS:  Unmoderated.PURPOSE: Discussions about setting up and installing Windows NT, and about system and peripheral compatability issues for Windows NT.NAME: comp.os.ms-windows.nt.miscSTATUS: Unmoderated.PURPOSE: Miscellaneous non-programming discussions about using Windows NT, including issues such as security, networking features, console mode and Windows 3.1 (Win16) compatability.RATIONALE:Microsoft NT is the newest member of the Microsoft Windows familyof operating systems (or operating environments for those who wishto argue about the meaning of an \"OS\").  The family ranges fromModular Windows through Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups toWindows NT at the high end.  To date, Microsoft has shipped over50,000 beta copies and pre-release SDKs of Windows NT -- theactual release is slated for May/June \\'93.While Windows NT has an entirely new design internally, it sharesan application programming interface with the other members of theWindows family; its Win32 API includes the Win16 API used in Win-dows 3.1, and the Win32s API subset (Win32 less threads, networkingand security) can be used to create 32-bit applications forWindows 3.1.The user interface is also practically identical to that of Windows3.1, with the addition of logins and a few other features.  It usesProgram Manager, File Manager and other applets, and generally pre-sents an identical appearance to the user.  Many of the announcedWindows NT applications are ports of existing Windows 3.1 apps, andNT also runs existing 3.1 applications.Thus, it appears logical that Windows NT should share the followinggroups with the other members of the Windows family:comp.os.ms-windows.appscomp.os.ms-windows.programmer.toolscomp.os.ms-windows.programmer.misccomp.os.ms-windows.programmer.win32The following groups are also clearly applicable to Windows NT aswell as Windows 3.1:comp.os.ms-windows.announcecomp.os.ms-windows.advocacyIn conclusion, the only clear argument for the separation of theWindows 3.1 and Windows NT hierarchies is different internalstructures of Windows 3.1 and Windows NT.  And yet operatingsystems such as OS/2, Macintosh OS, Xenix and Coherent all haveundergone major rewrites without having been split into separatenewsgroup hierarchies.Further, Windows 3.1 is due for a major rewrite itself in 1994 --when the fully 32-bit, protected-mode and with-DOS-built-in next-generation Windows, \"Chicago\", debuts next year, surely it shouldremain in the same hierarchy.  And what, then, would be the jus-tification for separating Windows NT from other Windows versions?DISCUSSION PERIOD:The discussion period will run from 27 April, 1992 to 18 May, 1993.  VOTING:The CFV (Call for Votes) will be issued around 19 May, 1993, based onthe feedback received during the discussion period.  No votes willbe accepted prior to the CFV.-- [ /tom haapanen -- tomh@metrics.com -- software metrics inc -- waterloo, ont ][       \"stick your index fingers into both corners of your mouth.  now pull ][          up.  that\\'s how the corrado makes you feel.\"  -- car, january \\'93 ]',\n",

TRIAD, the first drag-free satellite, was designed and built by the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory and launched 2 Sept 1972.  The satellite was in three sections separated by two booms.  The central section housed the DISCOS Disturbance Compensation System, which consisted of a proof mass of special non-magnetic alloy housed within a spherical cavity.  The proof mass flew a true gravitational orbit, free from drag and radiation pressure.  Teflon microthrusters kept the body of the satellite centered around the proof mass, thereby flying the entire satellite drag free.     TRIAD was one of the APL-designed Navy Navigation Satellites.  The 2nd-generation operational navigation satellites flying today (NOVA) use a single-axis version of DISCOS.  TRIAD was also the sixth APL satellite to be powered by an RTG (APL flew the first nuclear power supply in space, in 1961).

Features===========DMPEG/DMPLAY is another MPEG decoder/player for the PC: - decodes (nearly) the full MPEG video standard   (I,P,B frames, frame size up to at least 352x240 supported) - saves decoded sequence in 8 or 24bit raw file for later display - optional on-screen display during decoding (requires VGA) - several dithering options: ordered dither, Floyd-Steinberg, grayscale - color-space selection - runs under DOS, 640KB RAM, no MS-Windows required - very compact (small code / small data models, 16 bit arithmetic) - real time display of the raw file by a separate player for   VGA and many Super-VGAs...4. Technical information========================The player is a rather straightforward implementation of the MPEG spec [1].The IDCT is based on the Chen-Wang 13 multiplication algorithm [2](not quite the optimum, I know). Blocks with not more than eight non-zerocoefficients use a non-separated direct multiply-accumulate 2D-IDCT(sounds great, doesn't it?), which turned out to be faster than a 'fast'algorithm in this (quite common) case. Dithering is pretty standard. Maindifference to the Berkeley decoder (except for the fewer number of supportedalgorithms) is the use of 256 instead of 128 colors, the (default) option touse a restricted color-space and the implementation of a color saturationdominant ordered dither. This leads to a significantly superior quality ofthe dithered image (I claim, judge yourself).Restricted color-space means that the U and V components are clipped to+/-0.25 (instead of +/-0.5) and the display color-space points are distributedover this restricted space. Since the distance between color-space pointsis thus reduced by a factor of two, the color resolution is doubled at theexpense of not being able to represent fully saturated colors.Saturation dominant ordered dither is a method by which a color, lyingsomewhere between the points of the display color space, is approximatedby primarily alternating between two points of constant hue instead ofconstant saturation. This yields subjectivly better quality due to thelower sensitivity of the human viewing system to saturation changes thanto hue changes (the same reasoning as used by the PAL TV standard to improveon NTSC). The improvement is particularly visible in dark brown or redishareas....--Stefan Eckart, stefan@lis.e-technik.tu-muenchen.de\",\n",

I'm not arguing about who is the better goaltender.  I'dtake Soderstrom right now.  What I am saying is that Roussel can be a #1netminder.  The GAA difference is less than half a goal per game (less thanthat after last night), their save percentages are close, and their recordsare similar.  And with that, I just don't see how you can label Roussel asthe most disappointing player on the Flyers this season.You say Soderstrom played against better competition.  That may very wellbe, but there is no way of knowing how Roussel would have performed inthose games.  Besides, against the better scoring teams like Pittsburgh,the defense is more keyed up than they are against San Jose.> The same> for Roussel in the Ranger game. Two real scoring chances, one he made a> great play, the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player. If> you were judging Roussel on that game alone, you have very little to go by.But I'm not just judging Roussel on that game alone.  I've seen him playfor the past two seasons in Philly and before that in Hershey.  It's justmy opinion, but I think he's got what it takes.  Of course, I thought thatabout Mark LaForest, too.  But I never did about Wendell Young.  So I'mbatting .500 in judging Hershey talent since the Hextall-era.As for the Rangers game, you can say he was saved by a mistake by theoffensive player if you like.  But Rou had his leg in position to make thesave.  If he didn't, it wouldn't have mattered if the Rangers player didn'tget the puck up or not.  It would have been a goal.  On a breakaway that'swhat the goalie wants to do, take away as much as possible and force theshooter to beat him.> But if you were to look at the 0-0 tie against the Habs, you saw a goalie> stand on his head to get that shutout. THAT was a #1 goalie in action.

And not to take anything away from Soderstrom because he wassenational in that game agains the Habs.  But you can't tell me that aMontreal player had an open net to shoot at some point during that gameand just flat out missed it.  Mistakes, both on offense and defense arepart of the game.  Or there'd never be shutouts.Anyway, I'm happy the Flyers have both Soderstrom and Roussel andI'm not going to argue about it anymore.

Gunduz receives an ultimatum: Either         he gives up his honorary position or he will be \"executed\". He         refuses. \"Responsibility\" is claimed by JCAG and SDPA.

Now he is attacked and murdered in cold blood.President Reagan orders an all-out manhunt-to no avail. An eye-witness who gave a description of the murderer is shot down.  He survives... but falls silent. One of the most revolting \"triumphs\" in the senseless, mindless history of Armenian terrorism. Such a murder brings absolutely nothing - except an ego boost for the murderer within the Armenian terrorist underworld, which is already wallowing in self-satisfaction. Were you involved in the murder of Sarik Ariyak?    December 17, 1980 - SydneyTwo Nazi Armenians massacre Sarik Ariyak and his bodyguard, Engin         Sever. JCAG and SDPA claim responsibility.It is public knowledge that the founder of the Marxist-Leninist terrorist organization, the ASALA (an integral part of ASALA/SDPA/ARF), HagopHagopian, began his notorious career as a member of the terrorist group which perpetrated the massacre of the Israeli athletes at theMunich Olympics in 1972. And the \\'Armenian Foundation\\' stole from the children of Turkiye to fund the criminal activities of the ASALA/SDPA/ARFterrorists in their cold-blooded murder of defenceless Turkish andKurdish people. THE ARMENIAN FOUNDATION PROVIDED 30 BILLION TL TO ASALA    01/09/92, MILLIYET-- The Armenian Foundation based inIstanbul is found to have provided 30 billion Turkish Lira ($6million) to the Armenian terrorist organization ASALA which havemurdered several Turkish diplomats abroad... Experts on international terrorism assert that the Armenian terroristsuse proceeds from drug trafficking (and from the Armenian Foundation)to fund their deadly enterprises. The deadliest of terrorist assassins,Carlos, proclaimed on Spanish television that his organization hadentered into a working relationship with Armenian terrorists and theyare using drug trafficking to raise money \\'to continue\\' to slaughterinnocent people. Now, what is your personal and organizational role in this scheme?Recent reports which have been confirmed by the U.S. Administration, indicate that Armenian terrorist organizations are collaborating with those who are responsible for the bombing of the United States Marine barracks in Beirut. You won\\'t be able to get away with your crimes forever; the justice is long overdue.As for the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people between 1914 and 1920:Source: Documents: Volume I (1919).        \"Document No: 42,\" Archive No: 1-2, Cabin No: 110, Drawer         No: 1(4), File No: 373, Section No: 1484(1032), Contents No: 9, 9-1.

It can doubtless be taken that Jael\\'s slaying of Sisera was a type of Mary\\'s victory over sin. But even if we take Deborah\\'s words as applying prophetically or symbolically to Mary, they must still be applicable literally to Jael.  We may well take them to mean that God used her as a part of His plan for the deliverance of His people, and that she has this in common with Mary.  But we have no reason to suppose that they mean that she was sinless, and thus no reason to take the like expression applied to Mary as proof that she was sinless.   Yours,  James Kiefer'"
